tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Johnny Town-mouse was born in a cupboard.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Timmy Willie was born in a garden.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Timmy Willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; he packed them in a big hamper.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"The gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in the wicker-work, and after eating some peas-Timmy Willie fell fast asleep."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"He awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horse's feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles-jolt-jolt-jolt!"
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"At last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"The cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,But there was no quiet; there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Timmy Willie, who had lived all his life in a garden, was almost frightened to death."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Out sprang the terrified Timmy Willie.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Up jumped the cook on a chair, exclaiming ""A mouse! a mouse! Call the cat! Fetch me the poker, Sarah!"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Timmy Willie did not wait for Sarah with the poker; he rushed along the skirting board till he came to a little hole, and in he popped."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"He dropped half a foot, and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party, breaking three glasses.-""Who in the world is this?"" inquired Johnny Town-mouse."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,But after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"With the utmost politeness he introduced Timmy Willie to nine other mice, all with long tails and white neckties."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Timmy Willie's own tail was insignificant.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Johnny Town-mouse and his friends noticed it; but they were too well bred to make personal remarks; only one of them asked Timmy Willie if he had ever been in a trap?
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"The dinner was of eight courses; not much of anything, but truly elegant."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"All the dishes were unknown to Timmy Willie, who would have been a little afraid of tasting them; only he was very hungry, and very anxious to behave with company manners."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"The continual noise upstairs made him so nervous, that he dropped a plate."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Never mind, they don't belong to us,"" said Johnny."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"It should be explained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Several times they had come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; Timmy Willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"His appetite failed, he felt faint."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Try some jelly?"" said Johnny Town-mouse."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""No? Would you rather go to bed? I will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,The sofa pillow had a hole in it.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Johnny Town-mouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed, kept exclusively for visitors."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,But the sofa smelt of cat.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Timmy Willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,It was just the same next day.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,An excellent breakfast was provided-for mice accustomed to eat bacon; but Timmy Willie had been reared on roots and salad.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the floors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"One particularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs with the tea-tray; there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be collected, in spite of the cat."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Timmy Willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,The food disagreed with him; the noise prevented him from sleeping.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"In a few days he grew so thin that Johnny Town-mouse noticed it, and questioned him."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,He listened to Timmy Willie's story and inquired about the garden.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""It sounds rather a dull place? What do you do when it rains?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""When it rains, I sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my Autumn store. I peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn, and my friend Cock Robin. And when the sun comes out again, you should see my garden and the flowers-roses and pinks and pansies-no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""There goes that cat again!"" exclaimed Johnny Town-mouse."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"When they had taken refuge in the coal-cellar he resumed the conversation; ""I confess I am a little disappointed; we have endeavoured to entertain you, Timothy William."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Oh yes, yes, you have been most kind; but I do feel so ill,"" said Timmy Willie."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""It may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food; perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Oh? Oh!"" cried Timmy Willie."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week,"" said Johnny rather huffily-""did you not know that the hamper goes back empty on Saturdays?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"So Timmy Willie said good-bye to his new friends, and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf; and after much jolting, he was set down safely in his own garden."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"Sometimes on Saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate, but he knew better than to get in again."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse had half promised a visit."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,The winter passed; the sun came out again; Timmy Willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,He had nearly forgotten his visit to town.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,When up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came Johnny Town-mouse!
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Timmy Willie received him with open arms.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""You have come at the best of all the year, we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""H'm'm! it is a little damp,"" said Johnny Town-mouse, who was carrying his tail under his arm, out of the mud."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""What is that fearful noise?"" he started violently."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""That?"" said Timmy Willie, ""that is only a cow; I will beg a little milk, they are quite harmless, unless they happen to lie down upon you. How are all our friends?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,Johnny's account was rather middling.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"He explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season; the family had gone to the sea-side for Easter; the cook was doing spring cleaning, on board wages, with particular instructions to clear out the mice."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"There were four kittens, and the cat had killed the canary."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""They say we did it; but I know better,"" said Johnny Town-mouse."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""Whatever is that fearful racket?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""That is only the lawn-mower; I will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed. I am sure you had better settle in the country, Johnny."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""H'm'm-we shall see by Tuesday week; the hamper is stopped while they are at the sea-side."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"""I am sure you will never want to live in town again,"" said Timmy Willie."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,But he did.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,He went back in the very next hamper of vegetables; he said it was too quiet!!
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"One place suits one person, another place suits another person."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,"For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."

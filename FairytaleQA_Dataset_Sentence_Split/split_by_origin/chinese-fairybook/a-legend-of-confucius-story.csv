a-legend-of-confucius,"When Confucius came to the earth, the Kilin, that strange beast which is the prince of all four-footed animals, and only appears when there is a great man on earth, sought the child and spat out a jade whereon was written: ""Son of the Watercrystal you are destined to become an uncrowned king!"""
a-legend-of-confucius,"And Confucius grew up, studied diligently, learned wisdom and came to be a saint."
a-legend-of-confucius,"He did much good on earth, and ever since his death has been reverenced as the greatest of teachers and masters."
a-legend-of-confucius,He had foreknowledge of many things.
a-legend-of-confucius,And even after he had died he gave evidence of this.
a-legend-of-confucius,"Once, when the wicked Emperor Tsin Schi Huang had conquered all the other kingdoms, and was traveling through the entire empire, he came to the homeland of Confucius."
a-legend-of-confucius,And he found his grave.
a-legend-of-confucius,"And, finding his grave, he wished to have it opened and see what was in it."
a-legend-of-confucius,"All his officials advised him not to do so, but he would not listen to them."
a-legend-of-confucius,"So a passage was dug into the grave, and in its main chamber they found a coffin, whose wood appeared to be quite fresh."
a-legend-of-confucius,When struck it sounded like metal.
a-legend-of-confucius,"To the left of the coffin was a door, which led into an inner chamber."
a-legend-of-confucius,"In this chamber stood a bed, and a table with books and clothing, all as though meant for the use of a living person."
a-legend-of-confucius,Tsin Schi Huang seated himself on the bed and looked down.
a-legend-of-confucius,"And there on the floor stood two shoes of red silk, whose tips were adorned with a woven pattern of clouds."
a-legend-of-confucius,A bamboo staff leaned against the wall.
a-legend-of-confucius,"The Emperor, in jest, put on the shoes, took the staff and left the grave."
a-legend-of-confucius,"But as he did so a tablet suddenly appeared before his eyes on which stood the following lines: O'er kingdoms six Tsin Schi Huang his army led, To ope my grave and find my humble bed; He steals my shoes and takes my staff away To reach Schakiu--and his last earthly day!"
a-legend-of-confucius,"Tsin Schi Huang was much alarmed, and had the grave closed again."
a-legend-of-confucius,But when he reached Schakiu he fell ill of a hasty fever of which he died.

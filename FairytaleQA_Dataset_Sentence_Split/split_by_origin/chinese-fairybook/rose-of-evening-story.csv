rose-of-evening,On the fifth day of the fifth month the festival of the Dragon Junk is held along the Yangtze-kiang.
rose-of-evening,"A dragon is hollowed out of wood, painted with an armor of scales, and adorned with gold and bright colors."
rose-of-evening,"A carved red railing surrounds this ship, and its sails and flags are made of silks and brocade."
rose-of-evening,The after part of the vessel is called the dragon's tail.
rose-of-evening,"It rises ten feet above the water, and a board which floats in the water is tied to it by means of a cloth."
rose-of-evening,"Upon this board sit boys who turn somersaults, stand on their heads, and perform all sorts of tricks."
rose-of-evening,"Yet, being so close to the water their danger is very great."
rose-of-evening,"It is the custom, therefore, when a boy is hired for this purpose, to give his parents money before he is trained."
rose-of-evening,"Then, if he falls into the water and is drowned, no one has him on their conscience."
rose-of-evening,"Farther South the custom differs in so much that instead of boys, beautiful girls are chosen for this purpose."
rose-of-evening,"In Dschen-Giang there once lived a widow named Dsiang, who had a son called Aduan."
rose-of-evening,"When he was no more than seven years of age he was extraordinarily skilful, and no other boy could equal him."
rose-of-evening,"And his reputation increasing as he grew, he earned more and more money."
rose-of-evening,So it happened that he was still called upon at the Dragon Junk Festival when he was already sixteen.
rose-of-evening,But one day he fell into the water below the Gold Island and was drowned.
rose-of-evening,"He was the only son of his mother, and she sorrowed over him, and that was the end of it."
rose-of-evening,Yet Aduan did not know that he had been drowned.
rose-of-evening,"He met two men who took him along with them, and he saw a new world in the midst of the waters of the Yellow River."
rose-of-evening,"When he looked around, the waves of the river towered steeply about him like walls, and a palace was visible, in which sat a man wearing armor and a helmet."
rose-of-evening,"His two companions said to him: ""That is the Prince of the Dragon's Cave!"" and bade him kneel."
rose-of-evening,"The Prince of the Dragon's Cave seemed to be of a mild and kindly disposition and said: ""We can make use of such a skilful lad. He may take part in the dance of the willow branches!"""
rose-of-evening,So he was brought to a spot surrounded by extensive buildings.
rose-of-evening,"He entered, and was greeted by a crowd of boys who were all about fourteen years of age."
rose-of-evening,"An old woman came in and they all called out: ""This is Mother Hia!"""
rose-of-evening,And she sat down and had Aduan show his tricks.
rose-of-evening,"Then she taught him the dance of the flying thunders of Tsian-Tang River, and the music that calms the winds on the sea of Dung-Ting."
rose-of-evening,"When the cymbals and kettledrums reechoed through all the courts, they deafened the ear."
rose-of-evening,"Then, again, all the courts would fall silent."
rose-of-evening,Mother Hia thought that Aduan would not be able to grasp everything the very first time; so she taught him with great patience.
rose-of-evening,"But Aduan had understood everything from the first, and that pleased old Mother Hia."
rose-of-evening,"""This boy,"" said she, ""equals our own Rose of Evening!"""
rose-of-evening,The following day the Prince of the Dragon's Cave held a review of his dancers.
rose-of-evening,"When all the dancers had assembled, the dance of the Ogres was danced first."
rose-of-evening,Those who performed it all wore devil-masks and garments of scales.
rose-of-evening,"They beat upon enormous cymbals, and their kettledrums were so large that four men could just about span them."
rose-of-evening,"Their sound was like the sound of a mighty thunder, and the noise was so great that nothing else could be heard."
rose-of-evening,"When the dance began, tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies, and then fell down again like star-glimmer which scatters in the air."
rose-of-evening,"The Prince of the Dragon Cave hastily bade the dance cease, and had the dancers of the nightingale round step forth."
rose-of-evening,These were all lovely young girls of sixteen.
rose-of-evening,"They made a delicate music with flutes, so that the breeze blew and the roaring of the waves was stilled in a moment."
rose-of-evening,"The water gradually became as quiet as a crystal world, transparent to its lowest depths."
rose-of-evening,"When the nightingale dancers had finished, they withdrew and posted themselves in the western courtyard."
rose-of-evening,Then came the turn of the swallow dancers.
rose-of-evening,These were all little girls.
rose-of-evening,"One among them, who was about fifteen years of age, danced the dance of the giving of flowers with flying sleeves and waving locks."
rose-of-evening,"And as their garments fluttered, many-colored flowers dropped from their folds, and were caught up by the wind and whirled about the whole courtyard."
rose-of-evening,"When the dance had ended, this dancer also went off with the rest of the girls to the western courtyard."
rose-of-evening,"Aduan looked at her from out the corner of his eye, and fell deeply in love with her."
rose-of-evening,"He asked his comrades who she might be and they told him she was named ""Rose of Evening."""
rose-of-evening,But the willow-spray dancers were now called out.
rose-of-evening,The Prince of the Dragon Cave was especially desirous of testing Aduan.
rose-of-evening,"So Aduan danced alone, and he danced with joy or defiance according to the music."
rose-of-evening,When he looked up and when he looked down his glances held the beat of the measure.
rose-of-evening,"The Dragon Prince, enchanted with his skill, presented him with a garment of five colors, and gave him a carbuncle set in golden threads of fish-beard for a hair-jewel."
rose-of-evening,"Aduan bowed his thanks for the gift, and then also hastened to the western courtyard."
rose-of-evening,There all the dancers stood in rank and file.
rose-of-evening,"Aduan could only look at Rose of Evening from a distance, but still Rose of Evening returned his glances."
rose-of-evening,"After a time Aduan gradually slipped to the end of his file and Rose of Evening also drew near to him, so that they stood only a few feet away from each other."
rose-of-evening,"But the strict rules allowed no confusion in the ranks, so they could only gaze and let their souls go out to each other."
rose-of-evening,Now the butterfly dance followed the others.
rose-of-evening,"This was danced by the boys and girls together, and the pairs were equal in size, age and the color of their garments."
rose-of-evening,"When all the dances had ended, the dancers marched out with the goose-step."
rose-of-evening,"The willow-spray dancers followed the swallow dancers, and Aduan hastened in advance of his company, while Rose of Evening lingered along after hers."
rose-of-evening,"She turned her head, and when she spied Aduan she purposely let a coral pin fall from her hair."
rose-of-evening,Aduan hastily hid it in his sleeve.
rose-of-evening,"When he had returned, he was sick with longing, and could neither eat nor sleep."
rose-of-evening,"Mother Hia brought him all sorts of dainties, looked after him three or four times a day, and stroked his forehead with loving care."
rose-of-evening,But his illness did not yield in the least.
rose-of-evening,"Mother Hia was unhappy, and yet helpless."
rose-of-evening,"""The birthday of the King of the Wu River is at hand,"" said she."
rose-of-evening,"""What is to be done?"""
rose-of-evening,"In the twilight there came a boy, who sat down on the edge of Aduan's bed and chatted with him."
rose-of-evening,"He belonged to the butterfly dancers, said he, and asked casually: ""Are you sick because of Rose of Evening?"""
rose-of-evening,"Aduan, frightened, asked him how he came to guess it."
rose-of-evening,"The other boy said, with a smile: ""Well, because Rose of Evening is in the same case as yourself."""
rose-of-evening,"Disconcerted, Aduan sat up and begged the boy to advise him."
rose-of-evening,"""Are you able to walk?"" asked the latter."
rose-of-evening,"""If I exert myself,"" said Aduan, ""I think I could manage it."""
rose-of-evening,So the boy led him to the South.
rose-of-evening,"There he opened a gate and they turned the corner, to the West."
rose-of-evening,"Once more the doors of the gate flew open, and now Aduan saw a lotus field about twenty acres in size."
rose-of-evening,"The lotus flowers were all growing on level earth, and their leaves were as large as mats and their flowers like umbrellas."
rose-of-evening,The fallen blossoms covered the ground beneath the stalks to the depth of a foot or more.
rose-of-evening,"The boy led Aduan in and said, ""Now first of all sit down for a little while!"""
rose-of-evening,Then he went away.
rose-of-evening,After a time a beautiful girl thrust aside the lotus flowers and came into the open.
rose-of-evening,It was Rose of Evening.
rose-of-evening,"They looked at each other with happy timidity, and each told how each had longed for the other."
rose-of-evening,And they also told each other of their former life.
rose-of-evening,"Then they weighted the lotus-leaves with stones so that they made a cozy retreat, in which they could be together, and promised to meet each other there every evening."
rose-of-evening,And then they parted.
rose-of-evening,Aduan came back and his illness left him.
rose-of-evening,From that time on he met Rose of Evening every day in the lotus field.
rose-of-evening,After a few days had passed they had to accompany the Prince of the Dragon Cave to the birthday festival of the King of the Wu River.
rose-of-evening,"The festival came to an end, and all the dancers returned home."
rose-of-evening,"Only, the King had kept back Rose of Evening and one of the nightingale dancers to teach the girls in his castle."
rose-of-evening,"Months passed and no news came from Rose of Evening, so that Aduan went about full of longing and despair."
rose-of-evening,Now Mother Hia went every day to the castle of the god of the Wu River.
rose-of-evening,"So Aduan told her that Rose of Evening was his cousin, and entreated her to take him along with her so that he could at least see her a single time."
rose-of-evening,"So she took him along, and let him stay at the lodge-house of the river-god for a few days."
rose-of-evening,But the indwellers of the castle were so strictly watched that he could not see Rose of Evening even a single time.
rose-of-evening,Sadly Aduan went back again.
rose-of-evening,"Another month passed and Aduan, filled with gloomy thoughts, wished that death might be his portion."
rose-of-evening,"One day Mother Hia came to him full of pity, and began to sympathize with him."
rose-of-evening,"""What a shame,"" said she, ""that Rose of Evening has cast herself into the river!"""
rose-of-evening,"Aduan was extremely frightened, and his tears flowed resistlessly."
rose-of-evening,"He tore his beautiful garments, took his gold and his pearls, and went out with the sole idea of following his beloved in death."
rose-of-evening,"Yet the waters of the river stood up before him like walls, and no matter how often he ran against them, head down, they always flung him back."
rose-of-evening,"He did not dare return, since he feared he might be questioned about his festival garments, and severely punished because he had ruined them."
rose-of-evening,"So he stood there and knew not what to do, while the perspiration ran down to his ankles."
rose-of-evening,"Suddenly, at the foot of the water-wall he saw a tall tree."
rose-of-evening,"Like a monkey he climbed up to its very top, and then, with all his might, he shot into the waves."
rose-of-evening,"And then, without being wet, he found himself suddenly swimming on the surface of the river."
rose-of-evening,Unexpectedly the world of men rose up once more before his dazzled eyes.
rose-of-evening,"He swam to the shore, and as he walked along the river-bank, his thoughts went back to his old mother."
rose-of-evening,He took a ship and traveled home.
rose-of-evening,"When he reached the village, it seemed to him as though all the houses in it belonged to another world."
rose-of-evening,"The following morning he entered his mother's house, and as he did so, heard a girl's voice beneath the window saying: ""Your son has come back again!"""
rose-of-evening,"The voice sounded like the voice of Rose of Evening, and when she came to greet him at his mother's side, sure enough, it was Rose of Evening herself."
rose-of-evening,And in that hour the joy of these two who were so fond of each other overcame all their sorrow.
rose-of-evening,"But in the mother's mind sorrow and doubt, terror and joy mingled in constant succession in a thousand different ways."
rose-of-evening,"When Rose of Evening had been in the palace of the river-king, and had come to realize that she would never see Aduan again, she determined to die, and flung herself into the waters of the stream."
rose-of-evening,"But she was carried to the surface, and the waves carried and cradled her till a ship came by and took her aboard."
rose-of-evening,They asked whence she came.
rose-of-evening,"Now Rose of Evening had originally been a celebrated singing girl of Wu, who had fallen into the river and whose body had never been found."
rose-of-evening,"So she thought to herself that, after all, she could not return to her old life again."
rose-of-evening,"So she answered: ""Madame Dsiang, in Dschen-Giang is my mother-in-law."""
rose-of-evening,Then the travelers took passage for her in a ship which brought her to the place she had mentioned.
rose-of-evening,"The widow Dsiang first said she must be mistaken, but the girl insisted that there was no mistake, and told Aduan's mother her whole story."
rose-of-evening,"Yet, though the latter was charmed by her surpassing loveliness, she feared that Rose of Evening was too young to live a widow's life."
rose-of-evening,"But the girl was respectful and industrious, and when she saw that poverty ruled in her new home, she took her pearls and sold them for a high price."
rose-of-evening,Aduan's old mother was greatly pleased to see how seriously the girl took her duties.
rose-of-evening,Now that Aduan had returned again Rose of Evening could not control her joy.
rose-of-evening,"And even Aduan's old mother cherished the hope that, after all, perhaps her son had not died."
rose-of-evening,"She secretly dug up her son's grave, yet all his bones were still lying in it."
rose-of-evening,So she questioned Aduan.
rose-of-evening,"And then, for the first time, the latter realized that he was a departed spirit."
rose-of-evening,Then he feared that Rose of Evening might regard him with disgust because he was no longer a human being.
rose-of-evening,"So he ordered his mother on no account to speak of it, and this his mother promised."
rose-of-evening,Then she spread the report in the village that the body which had been found in the river had not been that of her son at all.
rose-of-evening,"Yet she could not rid herself of the fear that, since Aduan was a departed spirit, heaven might refuse to send him a child."
rose-of-evening,"In spite of her fear, however, she was able to hold a grandson in her arms in course of time."
rose-of-evening,"When she looked at him, he was no different from other children, and then her cup of joy was filled to overflowing."
rose-of-evening,Rose of Evening gradually became aware of the fact that Aduan was not really a human being.
rose-of-evening,"""Why did you not tell me at once?"" said she."
rose-of-evening,"""Departed spirits who wear the garments of the dragon castle, surround themselves with a soul-casing so heavy in texture that they can no longer be distinguished from the living. And if one can obtain the lime made of dragon-horn which is in the castle, then the bones may be glued together in such wise that flesh and blood will grow over them again. What a pity that we could not obtain the lime while we were there!"""
rose-of-evening,"Aduan sold his pearl, for which a merchant from foreign parts gave him an enormous sum."
rose-of-evening,Thus his family grew very wealthy.
rose-of-evening,"Once, on his mother's birthday, he danced with his wife and sang, in order to please her."
rose-of-evening,The news reached the castle of the Dragon Prince and he thought to carry off Rose of Evening by force.
rose-of-evening,"But Aduan, alarmed, went to the Prince, and declared that both he and his wife were departed spirits."
rose-of-evening,"They examined him and since he cast no shadow, his word was taken, and he was not robbed of Rose of Evening."

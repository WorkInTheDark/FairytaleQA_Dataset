the-miserly-farmer,Once upon a time there was a farmer who had carted pears to market.
the-miserly-farmer,"Since they were very sweet and fragrant, he hoped to get a good price for them."
the-miserly-farmer,A bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his cart and asked for one.
the-miserly-farmer,"The farmer repulsed him, but the bonze did not go."
the-miserly-farmer,Then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names.
the-miserly-farmer,"The bonze said: ""You have pears by the hundred in your cart. I only ask for one. Surely that does you no great injury. Why suddenly grow so angry about it?"""
the-miserly-farmer,The bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go.
the-miserly-farmer,But the farmer would not and did not.
the-miserly-farmer,"An artisan saw the whole affair from his shop, and since the noise annoyed him, he took some money, bought a pear and gave it to the bonze."
the-miserly-farmer,"The bonze thanked him and said: ""One like myself, who has given up the world, must not be miserly. I have beautiful pears myself, and I invite you all to eat them with me."""
the-miserly-farmer,"Then some one asked: ""If you have pears then why do you not eat your own?"""
the-miserly-farmer,"He answered: ""I first must have a seed to plant."""
the-miserly-farmer,And with that he began to eat the pear with gusto.
the-miserly-farmer,"When he had finished, he held the pit in his hand, took his pick-ax from his shoulder; and dug a hole a couple of inches deep."
the-miserly-farmer,"Into this he thrust the pit, and covered it with earth."
the-miserly-farmer,"Then he asked the folk in the market place for water, with which to water it."
the-miserly-farmer,"A pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street, and with it the bonze watered the pit."
the-miserly-farmer,Thousands of eyes were turned on the spot.
the-miserly-farmer,And the pit could already be seen to sprout.
the-miserly-farmer,The sprout grew and in a moment it had turned into a tree.
the-miserly-farmer,Branches and leaves burgeoned out from it.
the-miserly-farmer,"It began to blossom and soon the fruit had ripened: large, fragrant pears, which hung in thick clusters from the boughs."
the-miserly-farmer,The bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders.
the-miserly-farmer,In a moment all the pears had been eaten up.
the-miserly-farmer,Then the bonze took his pick-ax and cut down the tree.
the-miserly-farmer,"Crash, crash!"
the-miserly-farmer,"so it went for a while, and the tree was felled."
the-miserly-farmer,Then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait.
the-miserly-farmer,"When the bonze had begun to make his magic, the farmer, too, had mingled with the crowd."
the-miserly-farmer,With neck outstretched and staring eyes he had stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do with his pears.
the-miserly-farmer,When the bonze had gone off he turned around to look after his cart.
the-miserly-farmer,His pears had all disappeared.
the-miserly-farmer,Then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own.
the-miserly-farmer,"He looked more closely, and the axle of his cart had disappeared."
the-miserly-farmer,It was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently.
the-miserly-farmer,The farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could.
the-miserly-farmer,"And when he turned the corner, there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall."
the-miserly-farmer,And then he realized that the pear-tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle.
the-miserly-farmer,"The bonze, however, was nowhere to be found."
the-miserly-farmer,And the whole crowd in the market burst out into loud laughter.

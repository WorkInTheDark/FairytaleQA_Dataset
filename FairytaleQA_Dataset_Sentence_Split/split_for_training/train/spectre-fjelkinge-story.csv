spectre-fjelkinge,"During the first half of the eighteenth century, several large estates in Schonen were the property of the family of Barnekow."
spectre-fjelkinge,"Or rather, they were property of its most distinguished representative at that time, Margaret Barnekow."
spectre-fjelkinge,"She was the daughter of the famous captain and governor-general Count Rutger of Aschenberg, and the wife of Colonel Kjell Kristofer Barnekow."
spectre-fjelkinge,"A widow at twenty-nine, she herself took over the management of her large properties."
spectre-fjelkinge,"She showed evidence of invincible courage, an endless capacity for work, and a tireless concern for all her many dependents and servitors."
spectre-fjelkinge,"While traveling about her estates, Madame Margaret one evening came to the tavern in Fjelkinge."
spectre-fjelkinge,She was quartered for the night in a room that had the name of being haunted.
spectre-fjelkinge,Some years before a traveler had lain in the same room and presumably had been murdered.
spectre-fjelkinge,"At any rate, the man himself and all his belongings had disappeared without leaving a trace."
spectre-fjelkinge,The mystery had never been explained.
spectre-fjelkinge,Since that time the room had been haunted.
spectre-fjelkinge,"Those who knew about it preferred to travel a post-station further in the dark, rather than pass the night in the room in question."
spectre-fjelkinge,But Margaret Barnekow did not do so.
spectre-fjelkinge,"She had already shown greater courage in greater contingencies, and chose this particular room to sleep in without any fear."
spectre-fjelkinge,"She let the lamp burn and fell asleep, after she had said her evening prayer."
spectre-fjelkinge,"On the stroke of twelve she awoke, just as some planks were raised in the floor."
spectre-fjelkinge,"Up rose a bleeding phantom whose head, split wide open, hung down on his shoulder."
spectre-fjelkinge,"""Noble lady,"" whispered the specter, ""prepare a grave in consecrated earth for a murdered man. Deliver his murderer to the judgment which is his due!"""
spectre-fjelkinge,"God-fearing and unafraid, Madame Margaret beckoned the phantom nearer."
spectre-fjelkinge,He told her he had already addressed the same prayer to various other people.
spectre-fjelkinge,But none had had the courage to grant it.
spectre-fjelkinge,"Then Madame Margaret drew a gold ring from her finger, laid it on the gaping wound, and tied up the head of the murdered man with her kerchief."
spectre-fjelkinge,"With a glance of unspeakable gratitude he told her the murderer's name, and disappeared beneath the floor without a sound."
spectre-fjelkinge,The following morning Madame Margaret sent for the sheriff of the district to come to the tavern with some of his people.
spectre-fjelkinge,"She informed him of what had happened to her during the night, and ordered those present to tear up the floor."
spectre-fjelkinge,"And there they found, buried in the earth, the remains of a body and, in a wound in its head, the Countess's ring."
spectre-fjelkinge,Tied about its head was her kerchief.
spectre-fjelkinge,"One of the bystanders grew pale at the sight, and fell senseless to the ground."
spectre-fjelkinge,"When he came to his senses, he confessed that he had murdered the traveler and robbed him of his belongings."
spectre-fjelkinge,"He was condemned to death for his crime, and the body of the murdered man was buried in the village church-yard."
spectre-fjelkinge,"The ring, of peculiar shape, and its setting bearing a large gray stone, is still preserved in the Barnekow family."
spectre-fjelkinge,"Magic virtues in cases of sickness, fire and other misfortunes are ascribed to it."
spectre-fjelkinge,"And when one of the Barnekows dies, it is said that a red spot, like a drop of blood, appears on the stone."

lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"John Blessom once upon a time had gone down to Copenhagen to carry on a suit at law, for in those days one could not get justice in the land of Norroway; and if a man wanted his rights, there was nothing left for him to do but to travel to Copenhagen."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"This is what Blessom had done, and what his son did after him, for he, too, carried on a law-suit."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"Now it chanced that on Christmas Eve John had had speech with the gentleman in authority, and had attended to his business, and was going along the street in a low-spirited manner, for he was homesick."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"And as he went along, a man from Vaage, in a white blouse, with a knapsack, and buttons as big as silver dollars, passed him."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"He was a large, heavily-built man."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,It seemed to Blessom that he must know him; but he was walking very fast.
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""You are walking very fast,"" said John."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""Yes, but then I'm in a hurry,"" answered the man."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""I have to get back to Vaage this very evening."""
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""I only wish that I could get there!"" sighed John."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""You can stand on the runner of my sledge,"" said the man, ""for I have a horse that covers a mile in twelve steps."""
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"So they set out, and Blessom had all that he could do to hold fast to the runner of the sledge; for they went through weather and wind, and he could see neither heaven nor earth."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,Once they stopped and rested.
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"He could not tell exactly where it was, but when they began to hurry on again, he thought that he spied a skull on a pole."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"After they had gone on a while, John Blessom began to freeze."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""Alas, I forgot one of my gloves where we stopped, and now my hand is freezing!"" said he."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""Well, Blessom, you'll have to make the best of it,"" said the man."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""We are not far from Vaage now. When we stopped to rest we had covered half the way."""
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"When they crossed the Finnebridge, the man stopped and set John down."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"""Now you are not far from home,"" said he, ""but you must promise me that you will not look around, when you hear a roaring and notice a flare of light."""
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"John promised, and thanked him for the quick journey."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"The man drove off on his way, and John crossed the hill to his home."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"As he went he heard a roaring in the Jutulsberg, and the path before him suddenly grew so bright that one could have picked a needle from the ground."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"And he forgot what he had promised, and turned his head to see what was happening."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"There stood the giant gate of the Jutulsberg wide open, and out of it streamed a light and radiance as of thousands of candles."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"In the midst of it all stood the giant, and he was the man with whom he had driven."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,"But from that time forward John's head was twisted, and so it remained as long as he lived."

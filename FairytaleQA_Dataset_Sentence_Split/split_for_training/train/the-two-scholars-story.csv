the-two-scholars,Once upon a time there were two scholars.
the-two-scholars,One was named Liu Tschen and the other Yuan Dschau.
the-two-scholars,Both were young and handsome.
the-two-scholars,One spring day they went together into the hills of Tian Tai to gather curative herbs.
the-two-scholars,There they came to a little valley where peach-trees blossomed luxuriantly on either side.
the-two-scholars,"In the middle of the valley was a cave, where two maidens stood under the blossoming trees, one of them clad in red garments, the other in green."
the-two-scholars,And they were beautiful beyond all telling.
the-two-scholars,They beckoned to the scholars with their hands.
the-two-scholars,"""And have you come?"""
the-two-scholars,they asked.
the-two-scholars,"""We have been waiting for you overlong!"""
the-two-scholars,Then they led them into the cave and served them with tea and wine.
the-two-scholars,"""I have been destined for the lord Liu,"" said the maiden in the red gown; ""and my sister is for the lord Yuan!"""
the-two-scholars,And so they were married.
the-two-scholars,Every day the two scholars gazed at the flowers or played chess so that they forgot the mundane world completely.
the-two-scholars,"They only noticed that at times the peach-blossoms on the trees before the cave opened, and at others that they fell from the boughs."
the-two-scholars,"And, at times, unexpectedly, they felt cold or warm, and had to change the clothing they were wearing."
the-two-scholars,And they marveled within themselves that it should be so.
the-two-scholars,"Then, one day, they were suddenly overcome by homesickness."
the-two-scholars,Both maidens were already aware of it.
the-two-scholars,"""When our lords have once been seized with homesickness, then we may hold them no longer,"" said they."
the-two-scholars,"On the following day they prepared a farewell banquet, gave the scholars magic wine to take along with them and said: ""We will see one another again. Now go your way!"""
the-two-scholars,And the scholars bade them farewell with tears.
the-two-scholars,"When they reached home the gates and doors had long since vanished, and the people of the village were all strangers to them."
the-two-scholars,They crowded about the scholars and asked who they might be.
the-two-scholars,"""We are Liu Tschen and Yuan Dschau. Only a few days ago we went into the hills to pick herbs!"""
the-two-scholars,With that a servant came hastening up and looked at them.
the-two-scholars,"At last he fell at Liu Tschen's feet with great joy and cried: ""Yes, you are really my master! Since you went away, and we had no news of any kind regarding you some seventy years or more have passed."""
the-two-scholars,"Thereupon he drew the scholar Liu through a high gateway, ornamented with bosses and a ring in a lion's mouth, as is the custom in the dwellings of those of high estate."
the-two-scholars,"And when he entered the hall, an old lady with white hair and bent back, leaning on a cane, came forward and asked: ""What man is this?"""
the-two-scholars,"""Our master has returned again,"" replied the servant."
the-two-scholars,"And then, turning to Liu he added: ""That is the mistress. She is nearly a hundred years old, but fortunately is still strong and in good health."""
the-two-scholars,Tears of joy and sadness filled the old lady's eyes.
the-two-scholars,"""Since you went away among the immortals, I had thought that we should never see each other again in this life,"" said she."
the-two-scholars,"""What great good fortune that you should have returned after all!"""
the-two-scholars,"And before she had ended the whole family, men and women, came streaming up and welcomed him in a great throng outside the hall."
the-two-scholars,"And his wife pointed out this one and that and said: ""That is so and so, and this is so and so!"""
the-two-scholars,"At the time the scholar had disappeared there had been only a tiny boy in his home, but a few years old."
the-two-scholars,And he was now an old man of eighty.
the-two-scholars,"He had served the empire in a high office, and had already retired to enjoy his old age in the ancestral gardens."
the-two-scholars,"There were three grand-children, all celebrated ministers; there were more than ten great-grand-children, of whom five had already passed their examinations for the doctorate; there were some twenty great-great-grand-children, of whom the oldest had just returned home after having passed his induction examinations for the magistracy with honor."
the-two-scholars,"And the little ones, who were carried in their parents' arms, were not to be counted."
the-two-scholars,"The grand-children, who were away, busy with their duties, all asked for leave and returned home when they heard that their ancestor had returned."
the-two-scholars,"And the girl grand-children, who had married into other families, also came."
the-two-scholars,"This filled Liu with joy, and he had a family banquet prepared in the hall, and all his descendants, with their wives and husbands sat about him in a circle."
the-two-scholars,"He himself and his wife, a white-haired, wrinkled old lady, sat in their midst at the upper end."
the-two-scholars,"The scholar himself still looked like a youth of twenty years, so that all the young people in the circle looked around and laughed."
the-two-scholars,"Then the scholar said: ""I have a means of driving away old age!"""
the-two-scholars,And he drew out his magic wine and gave his wife some of it to drink.
the-two-scholars,"And when she had taken three glasses, her white hair gradually turned black again, her wrinkles disappeared, and she sat beside her husband, a handsome young woman."
the-two-scholars,Then his son and the older grand-children came up and all asked for a drink of the wine.
the-two-scholars,And whichever of them drank only so much as a drop of it was turned from an old man into a youth.
the-two-scholars,The tale was bruited abroad and came to the emperor's ears.
the-two-scholars,"The emperor wanted to call Liu to his court, but he declined with many thanks."
the-two-scholars,Yet he sent the emperor some of his magic wine as a gift.
the-two-scholars,"This pleased the emperor greatly, and he gave Liu a tablet of honor, with the inscription: ""The Common Home of Five Generations"" Besides this he sent him three signs which he had written with his own imperial brush signifying: ""Joy in longevity"""
the-two-scholars,"As to the other of the two scholars, Yuan Dschau, he was not so fortunate."
the-two-scholars,"When he came home he found that his wife and child had long since died, and his grand-children and great-grand-children were mostly useless people."
the-two-scholars,"So he did not remain long, but returned to the hills."
the-two-scholars,"Yet Liu Tschen remained for some years with his family, then taking his wife with him, went again to the Tai Hills and was seen no more."

tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Once upon a time there was a wood-mouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,She lived in a bank under a hedge.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Such a funny house!
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"There was a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!"
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dust-pan."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,She bundled the spider out at a window.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--""Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,said the bumble bee.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,She wished that she had a broom.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,But it was full of untidy dry moss.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I will have them turned out--"" ""Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!""--""I wonder who would help me?"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"" --""I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet."""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"When she got back to the parlour, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!"
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself,"" said Mr. Jackson."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,First she offered him cherry-stones.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!"" said Mr. Jackson."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Then she offered him thistle-down seed--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!"" said Mr. Jackson."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,He blew the thistle-down all over the room.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really--_really_ should like--would be a little dish of honey!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson,"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"" said the smiling Mr. Jackson, ""I can _smell_ it; that is why I came to call."""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,First he squeezed into the pantry.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Then he squeezed into the larder.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""And without any invitation!"" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"They went along the sandy passage--""Tiddly widdly--"" ""Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,"" said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Get out, you nasty old toad!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,shrieked Babbitty Bumble.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I shall go distracted!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,She shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,He seemed to have no objection to stings.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"But the untidiness was something dreadful--""Never did I see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet--all over my nice clean house!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,She gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,But she was too tired to do any more.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"""Will it ever be tidy again?"" said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight.
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"So they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honey-dew through the window, and he was not at all offended."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,"He sat outside in the sun, and said--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"""

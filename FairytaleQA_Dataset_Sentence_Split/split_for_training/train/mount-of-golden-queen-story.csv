mount-of-golden-queen,Once upon a time a lad who tended the cattle in the wood was eating his noon-tide meal in a clearing in the forest.
mount-of-golden-queen,As he was sitting there he saw a rat run into a juniper-bush.
mount-of-golden-queen,His curiosity led him to look for it.
mount-of-golden-queen,"As he bent over, down he went, head over heels, and fell asleep."
mount-of-golden-queen,And he dreamed that he was going to find the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen; but that he did not know the way.
mount-of-golden-queen,The following day he once more pastured his cattle in the wood.
mount-of-golden-queen,"When he came to the same clearing, and again ate his dinner there."
mount-of-golden-queen,"And again he saw the rat and went to look for it, and again when he bent down he went head over heels, and fell fast asleep."
mount-of-golden-queen,"And again he dreamed of the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen, and that in order to get her he would need seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes."
mount-of-golden-queen,He awoke and it was all a dream.
mount-of-golden-queen,"By now he had made up his mind to find the Mount of the Golden Queen, and he went home with his herd."
mount-of-golden-queen,"On the third day, when he led out his cattle, he could not reach the clearing of his happy dream too soon."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Again the rat showed itself and when he went to look for it, he fell asleep as he had done each preceding day."
mount-of-golden-queen,"And again he dreamed of the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen, and that she came to him, and laid a letter and a band of gold in his pocket."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Then he awoke and to his indescribable surprise, he found in his pocket both of the things of which he had dreamed, the letter and the band."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Now he had no time to attend to the cattle any longer, but drove them straight home."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Then he went into the stable, led out a horse, sold it, and bought seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes with the money."
mount-of-golden-queen,"He made the thole-pins out of the iron, put on his iron shoes, and set forth."
mount-of-golden-queen,For a time he traveled by land.
mount-of-golden-queen,At last he came to the lake which he had to cross.
mount-of-golden-queen,"He saw nothing but water before and behind him, and rowing so long and steadily that he wore out one thole-pin after another."
mount-of-golden-queen,"He at length reached land, and a green meadow, where no trees grew."
mount-of-golden-queen,"He walked all around the meadow, and at last found a mound of earth from which smoke was rising."
mount-of-golden-queen,"When he looked more closely, out came a woman who was nine yards long."
mount-of-golden-queen,He asked her to tell him the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen.
mount-of-golden-queen,"But she replied: ""That I do not know. Go ask my sister, who is nine yards taller than I am, and who lives in an earth-mound which you can find without any trouble."""
mount-of-golden-queen,"So he left her and came to a mound of earth that looked just like the first, and from which smoke was also rising."
mount-of-golden-queen,"A woman at once came out who was tremendously tall, and of her he asked the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen."
mount-of-golden-queen,"""That I do not know,"" said she."
mount-of-golden-queen,"""Go ask my brother, who is nine yards taller than I am, and who lives in a hill a little further away."""
mount-of-golden-queen,"So he came to the hill, from which smoke was also rising, and knocked."
mount-of-golden-queen,"A man at once came out who was a veritable giant, for he was twenty-seven yards in length, and of him he asked the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Then the giant took a whistle and whistled in every direction, to call together all the animals to be found on the earth."
mount-of-golden-queen,"And all the animals came from the woods, notably among them a bear."
mount-of-golden-queen,"The giant asked him about the Mount of the Golden Queen, but he knew nothing of it."
mount-of-golden-queen,Again the giant blew his whistle in every direction to call together all the fishes to be found in the waters.
mount-of-golden-queen,"They came at once, and he asked them about the Mount of the Golden Queen; but they knew nothing of it."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Once more the giant blew his whistle in every direction, and called together all the birds of the air."
mount-of-golden-queen,"They came, and he asked the eagle about the Mount of the Golden Queen, and whether he knew where it might be."
mount-of-golden-queen,"The eagle said: ""Yes!"""
mount-of-golden-queen,"""Well then, take this lad there,"" said the giant ""but do not treat him unkindly!"""
mount-of-golden-queen,"This the eagle promised, allowed the youth to seat himself on his back, and then off they were through the air, over fields and forests, hill and dale."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Before long they were above the ocean, and could see nothing but sky and water."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Then the eagle dipped the youth in the ocean up to his ankles and asked: ""Are you afraid?"""
mount-of-golden-queen,"""No,"" said the youth."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Then the eagle flew on a while, and again dipped the youth into the water, up to his knees and said: ""Are you afraid?"""
mount-of-golden-queen,"""Yes,"" answered the youth, ""but the giant said you were not to treat me unkindly."""
mount-of-golden-queen,"""Are you really afraid?"" asked the eagle once more."
mount-of-golden-queen,"""Yes,"" answered the youth."
mount-of-golden-queen,"Then the eagle said: ""The fear you now feel is the very same fear I felt when the princess thrust the letter and the golden band into your pocket."""
mount-of-golden-queen,"And with that they had reached a large, high mountain in one side of which was a great iron door."
mount-of-golden-queen,"They knocked, and a serving-maid appeared to open the door and admit them."
mount-of-golden-queen,The youth remained and was well received.
mount-of-golden-queen,The eagle said farewell and flew back to his native land.
mount-of-golden-queen,"The youth asked for a drink, and he was at once handed a beaker containing a refreshing draught."
mount-of-golden-queen,"When he had emptied it and returned the beaker, he let the golden band drop into it."
mount-of-golden-queen,"And when the maid brought back the beaker to her mistress-who was the princess of the Mount of the Golden Queen-the latter looked into the beaker, and behold, there lay a golden band which she recognized as her own."
mount-of-golden-queen,"So she asked: ""Is there some one here?"""
mount-of-golden-queen,"and when the maid answered in the affirmative, the princess said: ""Bid him come in!."""
mount-of-golden-queen,"As soon as the youth entered, she asked him if he chanced to have a letter."
mount-of-golden-queen,"The youth drew out the letter he had received in so strange a manner, and gave it to the princess."
mount-of-golden-queen,"And when she had read it she cried, full of joy: ""Now I am delivered!"""
mount-of-golden-queen,"At that very moment the mountain turned into a most handsome castle, with all sorts of precious things, servants, and every sort of convenience, each for its own purpose."
mount-of-golden-queen,(Whether the princess and the youth married the story does not say; yet we must take for granted that a wedding is the proper end for the fairy-tale).

tale-of-tom-kitten,"Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet."
tale-of-tom-kitten,They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"But one day their mother-Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit-expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived."
tale-of-tom-kitten,First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Then she brushed their fur, (this one is Mittens)."
tale-of-tom-kitten,Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Tom was very naughty, and he scratched."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off."
tale-of-tom-kitten,His mother sewed them on again.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"""Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks."""
tale-of-tom-kitten,Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.
tale-of-tom-kitten,Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.
tale-of-tom-kitten,When they stood up there were several green smears!
tale-of-tom-kitten,"""Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall,"" said Moppet."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road."
tale-of-tom-kitten,Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left."
tale-of-tom-kitten,He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat!"
tale-of-tom-kitten,"and the three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-pit pat paddle pat!"
tale-of-tom-kitten,pit pat waddle pat!
tale-of-tom-kitten,"They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens."
tale-of-tom-kitten,They had very small eyes and looked surprised.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on."
tale-of-tom-kitten,Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
tale-of-tom-kitten,Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"""Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck ,"" said Moppet-""Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!"""
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles."
tale-of-tom-kitten,But he put them on himself!
tale-of-tom-kitten,They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"""It's a very fine morning!"" said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping step-pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!"
tale-of-tom-kitten,Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"""My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit."
tale-of-tom-kitten,She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.
tale-of-tom-kitten,Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!"
tale-of-tom-kitten,As for the Puddle-Ducks-they went into a pond.
tale-of-tom-kitten,"The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons."
tale-of-tom-kitten,"And Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since."

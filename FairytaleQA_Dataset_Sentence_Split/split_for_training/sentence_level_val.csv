kari-woodencoat,"ONCE upon a time there was a king whose wife had died, but he had a daughter who was so good and so beautiful that no one could have been kinder or lovelier than she."
kari-woodencoat,"The king mourned a long time for the queen, because he had loved her greatly; but in the course of time he grew weary of his lonely life, and married again with the widow of another king, who also had a daughter; but one who was just as ugly and evil as the other was handsome and kind."
kari-woodencoat,"The step-mother and daughter were jealous of the king's daughter, because she was so handsome; yet so long as the king was at home, they did not dare harm her, for he was very fond of her."
kari-woodencoat,"But after a time, the king began to war against another king, and went out to battle."
kari-woodencoat,"Then the queen thought she now could do as she wished, and she let the king's daughter starve, and beat and pushed her about everywhere."
kari-woodencoat,"At last everything else was too good for her, and she had to herd the cows."
kari-woodencoat,"So she went out with the cows, and pastured them in the forest or on the hill."
kari-woodencoat,"Food she had little or none, and she grew pale and thin, and was sad most of the time, and wept."
kari-woodencoat,"In the herd there was also a great blue bull, who always kept himself neat and clean, and often came to the king's daughter and let her scratch him."
kari-woodencoat,"Once, as she sat there and cried and was sad, he came to her again, and asked why she was so unhappy."
kari-woodencoat,She did not answer him but kept on weeping.
kari-woodencoat,"""Well, I know what your trouble is,"" said the bull, ""even though you will not tell me. You are weeping because the queen is so unkind to you, and would gladly starve you to death. But you need not worry about food, for in my left ear is a cloth and, if you will take it out and spread it, you can have as much as you want to eat."""
kari-woodencoat,"She did so, took out the cloth, laid it on the grass, and it was at once covered with the finest dishes one might desire: bread and mead and honey-cake."
kari-woodencoat,"Then she soon regained her strength, and grew so plump, and so rose and white complexioned that the queen and her daughter, who was as thin as a rail, turned green and yellow with envy."
kari-woodencoat,The queen could not understand how it was that her step-daughter came to look so well in spite of such poor fare.
kari-woodencoat,"So she told a maid to follow her to the forest, and watch and see how it came about; for she thought some of the servants secretly gave her food."
kari-woodencoat,"The maid followed her into the forest, and watched carefully, and saw how the step-daughter drew the cloth out of the blue bull's left ear, and spread it out, and how it covered itself with the finest dishes, and also how the king's daughter ate heartily."
kari-woodencoat,And the maid told the queen at home about it.
kari-woodencoat,"Now the king came home, and he had defeated the other king, against whom he had warred; and the whole castle was overjoyed, and none was more joyful than the king's daughter."
kari-woodencoat,"But the queen pretended to be ill, and gave the physician a great deal of money so that he should say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull's flesh to eat."
kari-woodencoat,"The king's daughter and others as well asked the physician whether nothing else would do, and pleaded for the bull; for all liked him, and said that there was not such another in the whole kingdom."
kari-woodencoat,"But no, he must be slaughtered, and he should be slaughtered, and there was no help for it."
kari-woodencoat,"When the king's daughter heard this, she felt sad, and went into the stable to the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"He stood and hung his head, and looked so mournful that she could not keep from weeping."
kari-woodencoat,"""Why do you weep?"""
kari-woodencoat,asked the bull.
kari-woodencoat,"Then she told him that the king had come home, and that the queen had pretended to be ill, and had forced the physician to say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull's flesh to eat, and that now he was to be slaughtered."
kari-woodencoat,"""Once she has done away with me, it will not be long before she does away with you,"" said the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""But if it suits you, we will run away from here to-night."""
kari-woodencoat,"The king's daughter did say that it would be bad enough to leave her father, but that at the same time it would be worse to remain under the same roof with the queen, and so she promised the bull to go with him."
kari-woodencoat,"In the evening, while the rest were asleep, the king's daughter crept down to the bull in the stable."
kari-woodencoat,"He took her on his back, and ran off as quickly as ever he could."
kari-woodencoat,"And when the people rose the following morning, and wanted to slaughter the bull, he was gone; and when the king rose and asked for his daughter, she was gone as well."
kari-woodencoat,"The king sent out messengers on all sides, and had the church-bells rung for her, but no one had seen anything of her."
kari-woodencoat,"In the meantime the bull trotted through many lands with the king's daughter, and they came to a great copper forest, whose trees, leaves and flowers were all of copper."
kari-woodencoat,"But before they entered it, the bull said to the king's daughter: ""Now when we get into the forest you must be very careful not to touch so much as a single leaf, or else it is all up with you and with me; for a troll with three heads lives here, and the forest belongs to him."""
kari-woodencoat,"Yes, indeed, she would be careful, and not touch anything."
kari-woodencoat,"And she was very careful, and leaned to one side, and thrust aside the branches; but the forest was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through, and for all that she was so careful, she did tear off a leaf, and it remained in her hand."
kari-woodencoat,"""Alas, alas!"" cried the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""What have you done! Now I must fight for my very life. But see that you keep the leaf carefully!"""
kari-woodencoat,"Straightway they reached the end of the forest, and at once a troll with three heads came rushing up."
kari-woodencoat,"""Who has touched my forest?"" cried he."
kari-woodencoat,"""The forest is as much mine as yours!"" was the bull's reply."
kari-woodencoat,"""We'll see if it is!"" shouted the troll."
kari-woodencoat,"""That suits me!"" cried the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"Then they rushed at each other, and the bull gored and butted with might and main."
kari-woodencoat,"But the troll was just as strong, and it took all day before the bull gained the upper hand."
kari-woodencoat,"And then he had so many wounds, and was so weak that he could scarcely walk."
kari-woodencoat,"So they had to halt for a whole day; but the bull told the queen's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll's girdle, and anoint him with the salve."
kari-woodencoat,"Thereupon he grew strong and well again, and they went on the next day."
kari-woodencoat,"Now they wandered for many, many days, and at last came to a silver forest, whose trees, branches, leaves, buds and all were of silver."
kari-woodencoat,"Before the bull entered the forest he said to the king's daughter: ""Now when we get into this forest, in heaven's name be careful! You must touch nothing, and not even tear off so much as a single leaf, or else it is all up with you and me. A troll with six heads lives here, and the forest belongs to him, and I will hardly be able to hold my own against him!"""
kari-woodencoat,"""Yes,"" said the king's daughter, ""indeed I will be careful, and not touch the least thing, just as you have told me."""
kari-woodencoat,"But when they entered the forest, it was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through."
kari-woodencoat,"She was as careful as she could be, and avoided the branches, and thrust them aside with her hands; but the branches struck her in the face each moment, and in spite of all her care a leaf did remain in her hand."
kari-woodencoat,"""Alas, alas!"" cried the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""What have you done! Now I must fight for my very life, for the troll with six heads is twice as strong as the first one; but see that you take care of the leaf and keep it carefully!"""
kari-woodencoat,At once the troll came rushing up.
kari-woodencoat,"""Who has touched my forest?"" cried he."
kari-woodencoat,"""The forest is as much mine as yours!"" cried the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""Oho, we'll see if it is!"" cried the troll."
kari-woodencoat,"""That suits me!"" said the bull, and rushed on the troll, gored him, and thrust his horns right through him."
kari-woodencoat,"But the troll was just as strong, and it took three whole days before the bull got the better of him."
kari-woodencoat,"After that he was so weak and feeble that he could scarcely move, and so full of wounds that his blood ran in streams."
kari-woodencoat,"Then he told the king's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll's girdle, and anoint him with the salve."
kari-woodencoat,"She did so, and he recovered again: yet they had to remain a time on the spot, until he was once more able to go on."
kari-woodencoat,"At last they set out again; but the bull was still weak, and at first they went slowly."
kari-woodencoat,"The king's daughter wanted to spare him, and said she was young and quick on her feet, and could walk very well; but this he would not allow, and she had to sit on his back."
kari-woodencoat,"Thus they wandered for a long time, and through many lands, and the king's daughter had no idea where they might be going; but at length they came to a golden forest."
kari-woodencoat,"It was very beautiful, and the gold dripped down from it, for the trees, and branches and leaves and buds were all of purest gold."
kari-woodencoat,And here all went as it had in the copper and silver forests.
kari-woodencoat,"The bull told the king's daughter that in no case was she to touch anything, since a troll with nine heads lived here, to whom the forest belonged."
kari-woodencoat,"And he was much larger and stronger than the two others together, and he did not believe he could hold his own against him."
kari-woodencoat,"Yes, said she, she would be sure to pay attention and positively would not touch a thing."
kari-woodencoat,"But when they entered the forest, it was even thicker than the silver forest, and the further they went the worse it became."
kari-woodencoat,"The forest grew thicker and denser, and at last it seemed as though it would be impossible to push on at all."
kari-woodencoat,"She was much afraid of tearing off anything, and wound and twisted and bent herself in every direction, in order to avoid the branches, and thrust them aside with her hands."
kari-woodencoat,"But each moment they struck her in the face, so that she could not see where she was reaching, and before she had a chance to think, she held a golden apple in her hand."
kari-woodencoat,"Then she was terribly frightened, and began to cry, and wanted to throw it away."
kari-woodencoat,"But the bull told her to keep it, and hide it carefully, and consoled her as best he could."
kari-woodencoat,"Yet he thought that the battle would be a hard one, and was in doubt as to whether it would end well."
kari-woodencoat,"But now the troll with the nine heads came rushing up, and he was so frightful that the king's daughter could scarcely bear to look at him."
kari-woodencoat,"""Who has touched my forest?"" he shouted."
kari-woodencoat,"""The forest is as much mine as yours!"" cried the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""We'll see if it is!"" cried the troll."
kari-woodencoat,"""That suits me!"" said the bull, and with this they rushed on each other, so that it was a fearsome sight, and the king's daughter nearly fainted."
kari-woodencoat,"The bull gored the troll through and through with his horns; but the troll was as strong as he, and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads, the others breathed fresh life into it, and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him."
kari-woodencoat,But then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit.
kari-woodencoat,His whole body was covered with wounds; and he could not even tell the king's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the troll's girdle and anoint him with the salve.
kari-woodencoat,"But she did so of her own accord, and then he recovered again."
kari-woodencoat,"Yet they had to stay where they were for three whole weeks, until he was able to go on again."
kari-woodencoat,"At last they once more went slowly on their way; for the bull said they still had a little further to go, and they went over many great hills and through thick forests."
kari-woodencoat,After a time they came to a rock.
kari-woodencoat,"""Do you see anything?"""
kari-woodencoat,asked the bull.
kari-woodencoat,"""No, I see only the sky and the rock,"" said the king's daughter."
kari-woodencoat,"But when they went on up the hills were more level, so that they had a broader outlook."
kari-woodencoat,"""Do you see something now?"" asked the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""Yes, I see a small castle, far, far in the distance,"" said the princess."
kari-woodencoat,"""And yet it is not so small,"" said the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"At length they came to a great mountain with a steep, rocky face."
kari-woodencoat,"""Do you see something now?"" asked the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""Yes, now I see the castle close by, and it is much, much larger,"" said the king's daughter."
kari-woodencoat,"""That is where you must go!"" said the bull."
kari-woodencoat,"""Just below the castle is a pig-sty, and if you go into it you will find a wooden coat. You must put it on, and go with it into the castle, and say your name is Kari Woodencoat, and ask for a place. But now take your little knife and cut off my head; then draw off my skin, roll it up and lay it at the foot of the rock. But in it you must place the copper leaf, and the silver leaf, and the golden apple. Outside, against the hill, is a stick, and if you want anything of me, all you need do is to knock at the mountain-side."""
kari-woodencoat,"At first the princess could not at all make up her mind to do this; but when the bull told her that this was the only reward he wanted for all the good he had done her, she could not refuse."
kari-woodencoat,"It made her heart ache, yet in spite of it, she took her knife and cut until she had cut off the head of the great beast, and had drawn off his skin, and then she laid the latter at the foot of the rock, and in it she placed the copper leaf, and the silver leaf, and the golden apple."
kari-woodencoat,"When she had done this she went to the pig-sty, but she wept a great deal and felt sad."
kari-woodencoat,"Then she put on the wooden coat, and went to the king's castle in it."
kari-woodencoat,"She asked for a place in the kitchen, and said her name was Kari Woodencoat."
kari-woodencoat,"Yes, said the cook, she might have a place if she cared to wash up, for the girl who had formerly attended to it had run away."
kari-woodencoat,"""And after you have been here a while, no doubt you will have enough of it, and run away from us, too,"" said he."
kari-woodencoat,"No, indeed, she would not do so."
kari-woodencoat,She was most industrious at her washing up.
kari-woodencoat,On Sunday they expected company at the king's castle; and Kari asked permission to take up water to wash in to the prince.
kari-woodencoat,"But the others laughed at her and cried; ""What do you want to do there? Do you think the prince will have anything to do with you, homely as you are?"""
kari-woodencoat,"But she kept on asking, and at length received permission."
kari-woodencoat,"And then, as she ran up the stairs, her wooden coat clattered so loudly that the prince came out and asked: ""And who are you?"""
kari-woodencoat,"""I came to bring you water to wash in,"" said Kari."
kari-woodencoat,"""Do you think I want the water you are bringing me?"" cried the prince, and poured the water out over her head."
kari-woodencoat,So she had to go off; but she asked permission to go to church.
kari-woodencoat,"And she received permission, for the church was close by."
kari-woodencoat,"But first she went to the rock and knocked at it with a stick, as the bull had told her."
kari-woodencoat,And a man came out at once and asked what she wanted.
kari-woodencoat,"The king's daughter said that she had permission to go to church and hear the sermon, but that she had no dress to wear."
kari-woodencoat,"Then the man gave her a dress that shone like the copper forest, and a horse and a saddle as well."
kari-woodencoat,"When she came to church she looked so beautiful that all the people wondered who she might be, and none of them listened to the sermon, because they were all looking at her."
kari-woodencoat,She even pleased the prince so much that he could not keep from looking at her.
kari-woodencoat,"When she left the church, the prince came after her, and closed the church door behind her, and kept one of the gloves she wore in his hand."
kari-woodencoat,"And then when she wanted to mount her horse, the prince came again, and asked her where she came from."
kari-woodencoat,"""From Washwaterland!"" said Kari, and while the prince pulled out the glove and wanted to give it to her, she said: ""Be there light before me, and darkness behind, That the place I ride to the prince may not find!"""
kari-woodencoat,"The prince had never yet seen such a handsome glove, and he traveled far, looking for the native land of the noble lady who had abandoned her glove, but no one could tell him where it might be."
kari-woodencoat,"The following Sunday some one had to go up to the prince, and bring him a towel."
kari-woodencoat,"""Cannot I go up?"" begged Kari."
kari-woodencoat,"""Is that all you want?"" said the rest in the kitchen."
kari-woodencoat,"""You saw yourself what happened to you the last time!"""
kari-woodencoat,"But Kari kept on asking, and finally she received permission, after all, and ran up the stairs so that her wooden coat fairly clattered."
kari-woodencoat,"The prince at once thrust his head out of the door, and when he saw that it was Kari, he tore the towel out of her hand and flung it at her head."
kari-woodencoat,"""Off with you, you horrid creature!"""
kari-woodencoat,cried he.
kari-woodencoat,"""Do you think I want a towel that you have touched with your dirty fingers?"""
kari-woodencoat,"After that the prince went to church, and Kari also begged permission to go."
kari-woodencoat,"The people asked her why she wanted to go to church, since she had nothing to wear but her ugly, black wooden coat."
kari-woodencoat,"But Kari said the pastor preached so beautifully that she loved to listen to him, and finally they allowed her to go."
kari-woodencoat,"She went to the wall of rock and knocked, and the man came out and gave her a dress that was far handsomer than the first; it was embroidered all over with silver, and gleamed like the silver forest; and she also received a splendid horse, with housings embroidered with silver, and a silver bridle."
kari-woodencoat,"When the king's daughter came to the church, the people were still standing before the church door."
kari-woodencoat,"In their astonishment they all asked each other who she might be, and the prince came running up at once, and wanted to hold her horse while she dismounted."
kari-woodencoat,"But she jumped right down, and said it would not be necessary, since the horse was so tame that it would stand still when she commanded, and come to her if she wished."
kari-woodencoat,Then every one went into the church.
kari-woodencoat,"But hardly any one paid any attention to the sermon; for they were all looking at Kari, and the prince fell deeper in love with her than he had the first time."
kari-woodencoat,"When the sermon was over, and she left the church and was about to mount her horse, the prince again came, and asked where she came from."
kari-woodencoat,"""From Towelland!"" said she, and let fall her riding-whip."
kari-woodencoat,"And when the prince stooped to pick it up, she said: ""Be there light before me, and darkness behind, That the place I ride to the prince may not find!"""
kari-woodencoat,"Off she was, and the prince did not know what had become of her."
kari-woodencoat,"He wandered about in the world, far and wide, looking for her native land."
kari-woodencoat,"But no one could tell him where it might be, and with that the prince finally had to content himself."
kari-woodencoat,"The following Sunday some one was to go up to the prince, and bring him a comb."
kari-woodencoat,"Kari begged that they would let her go, but the others reminded her of what had happened the last time, and scolded her for showing herself to the prince, ugly as she was, and in her wooden coat."
kari-woodencoat,"But she kept on asking, and finally they let her go with the comb."
kari-woodencoat,"When she once more came clattering up the stairs, the prince thrust his head out of the door, tore the comb from her hand, and shouted at her to be off."
kari-woodencoat,"Then the prince went to church, and Kari wanted to go as well."
kari-woodencoat,"The rest again asked her why she wanted to go to church, ugly as she was, since she did not even have clothes fit to appear in before other people."
kari-woodencoat,"The prince, or some one else might happen to see her, and that would mean unhappiness for herself and others."
kari-woodencoat,"But Kari said that the people would have other things to look at besides herself, and finally they let her go."
kari-woodencoat,Then everything happened exactly as on the other two occasions.
kari-woodencoat,"She went to the wall of rock, and knocked with the stick, and then the man came out, and gave her a dress that was far more beautiful than both of the others."
kari-woodencoat,"It was all pure gold and diamonds, and she also received a beautiful horse, with housings embroidered with gold, and a golden bridle."
kari-woodencoat,"When the king's daughter came to the church, the pastor and all the congregation were still standing before the church door, waiting for her."
kari-woodencoat,"The prince came running up at once, and wanted to hold her horse, but she jumped down and said: ""No, thanks, it is not necessary, for my horse is so tame that he will remain standing when I tell him to do so."""
kari-woodencoat,"So they all went into the church, and the pastor mounted the pulpit."
kari-woodencoat,"But not a soul listened to the sermon, because all the people were looking at the princess, and wondering where she came from, and the prince fell still more deeply in love than he had on the two other occasions."
kari-woodencoat,"He paid no attention to anything, and looked only at her."
kari-woodencoat,"When the sermon was over, and the king's daughter left the church, the prince had poured tar on the floor of the vestibule, so that he might have a chance to help the king's daughter across."
kari-woodencoat,"But she paid no attention to it, stepped right into the middle of the tar, and leaped over."
kari-woodencoat,"But one of her golden shoes stuck fast, and when she had mounted her horse, the prince came running out of the church and asked her whence she came."
kari-woodencoat,"""From Combland!"""
kari-woodencoat,she answered.
kari-woodencoat,"But when the prince wanted to hand her the golden shoe, she said: ""Be there light before me, and darkness behind, That the place I ride to the prince may not find!"""
kari-woodencoat,"And again the prince did not know where she had gone, and he wandered about the world a long time, looking for Combland; but since no one could tell him where it might be, he let it be known that he would marry the girl whose foot the golden shoe fitted."
kari-woodencoat,Then the handsome and the homely came scurrying up from the ends of the earth; but none of them had a foot so small that they could put on the golden shoe.
kari-woodencoat,"At last Kari's evil stepmother and her daughter also came, and the shoe fitted the latter."
kari-woodencoat,"But she was very homely, and looked so unsatisfactory that the prince kept his promise most unwillingly."
kari-woodencoat,"Notwithstanding, preparations were made for the wedding, and she was adorned with her bridal finery, but when they rode to church, a little bird sat in a tree and sang: ""A bit of the heel, And a bit of the toe, Kari Woodencoat's shoe Is filled with blood, I know!"""
kari-woodencoat,"And when they looked, the bird had told the truth, for blood was dripping from the shoe."
kari-woodencoat,"Then all the maids and all the women who were at the castle had to try on the shoe, but it would fit none of them."
kari-woodencoat,"""But where is Kari Woodencoat?"" asked the prince, for he had understood the song of the bird, and remembered it well."
kari-woodencoat,"""O she!"" said the others."
kari-woodencoat,"""It is not worth while having her come, for she has feet like a horse."""
kari-woodencoat,"""Be that as it may,"" said the prince."
kari-woodencoat,"""But all the rest have tried it on, so she shall try it on as well. Kari!"""
kari-woodencoat,"he called out through the door, and Kari came clattering up the stairs so that everything shook, just as though a whole regiment of dragoons had arrived."
kari-woodencoat,"""Now you shall try on the golden shoe, and be a princess!"""
kari-woodencoat,"said the others, and made fun of her."
kari-woodencoat,"But Kari took the shoe, put her foot into it without a bit of trouble, cast off her wooden coat, and stood there in her golden dress, so that she was all a-sparkle, and on her other foot she had the golden shoe's mate."
kari-woodencoat,"The prince recognized her at once, put his arm around her, and kissed her."
kari-woodencoat,"And she told him that she was a king's daughter, which made him still more happy, and then they celebrated their wedding."
kari-woodencoat,"""spin, span, spun, Now our tale is done!"""
the-corpse-watchers,"There was once a poor woman that had three daughters, and one day the eldest said, ""Mother, bake my cake and kill my cock till I go seek my fortune."""
the-corpse-watchers,"So she did, and when all was ready, says her mother to her, ""Which will you have--half of these with my blessing, or the whole with my curse?"""
the-corpse-watchers,"""Curse or no curse,"" says she, ""the whole is little enough."""
the-corpse-watchers,"So away she set, and if the mother didn't give her her curse, she didn't give her her blessing."
the-corpse-watchers,"She walked, and she walked, till she was tired and hungry, and then she sat down to take her dinner."
the-corpse-watchers,"While she was eating it a poor woman came up, and asked for a bit."
the-corpse-watchers,"""The dickens a bit you'll get from me,"" says she; ""it's all too little for myself."""
the-corpse-watchers,And the poor woman walked away very sorrowful.
the-corpse-watchers,"At nightfall she got lodging at a farmer's, and the woman of the house told her that she'd give her a spadeful of gold and a shovelful of silver if she'd only sit up and watch her son's corpse that was waking in the next room."
the-corpse-watchers,"She said she'd do that, and so, when the family were in their bed, she sat by the fire, and cast an eye from time to time on the corpse that was lying under the table."
the-corpse-watchers,"All at once the dead man got up in his shroud, and stood before her, and said, ""All alone, fair maid?"""
the-corpse-watchers,"She gave him no answer; when he had said it the third time he struck her with a switch, and she became a grey flag."
the-corpse-watchers,"About a week after, the second daughter went to seek her fortune, and she didn't care for her mother's blessing no more nor her sister, and the very same thing happened to her."
the-corpse-watchers,She was left a grey flag by the side of the other.
the-corpse-watchers,"At last the youngest went off in search of the other two, and she took care to carry her mother's blessing with her."
the-corpse-watchers,"She shared her dinner with the poor woman on the road, and she told her that she would watch over her."
the-corpse-watchers,"Well, she got lodging in the same place as the others, and agreed to mind the corpse."
the-corpse-watchers,"She sat up by the fire, with the dog and cat, and amused herself with some apples and nuts the mistress had given her."
the-corpse-watchers,"She thought it a pity that the man under the table was a corpse, he was so handsome."
the-corpse-watchers,"But at last he got up, and, says he, ""All alone, fair maid?"" and she wasn't long about an answer: All alone I am not, I've little dog Douse, and Pussy, my cat; I've apples to roast and nuts to crack, And all alone I am not."
the-corpse-watchers,"""Ho, ho!"" says he, ""you're a girl of courage, though you wouldn't have enough to follow me. I am now going to cross the quaking bog, and go through the burning forest. I must then enter the cave of terror and climb the hill of glass, and drop from the top of it into the Dead Sea."""
the-corpse-watchers,"""I'll follow you,"" says she, ""for I engaged to mind you."""
the-corpse-watchers,"He thought to prevent her, but she was stiff as he was stout."
the-corpse-watchers,"Out he sprang through the window, and she followed him, till they came to the ""Green Hills,"" and then says he: ""Open, open, Green Hills and let the light of the Green Hills through."""
the-corpse-watchers,"""Aye,"" says the girl, ""and let the fair maid too."""
the-corpse-watchers,"They opened, and the man and woman passed through, and there they were on the edge of a bog."
the-corpse-watchers,"He trod lightly over the shaky bits of moss and sod; and while she was thinking of how she'd get across, the old beggar appeared to her, but much nicer dressed, touched her shoes with a stick, and the soles spread a foot on each side."
the-corpse-watchers,So she easily got over the shaky marsh.
the-corpse-watchers,"The burning wood was at the edge of the bog, and there the good fairy flung a damp, thick cloak over her, and through the flames she went, and a hair of her head was not singed."
the-corpse-watchers,"Then they passed through the dark cavern of horrors, when she'd have heard the most horrible yells, only that the fairy stopped her ears with wax."
the-corpse-watchers,"She saw frightful things, with blue vapours round them, and felt the sharp rocks and the slimy backs of frogs and snakes."
the-corpse-watchers,"When they got out of the cavern, they were at the mountain of glass; and then the fairy made her slippers so sticky with a tap of her rod that she followed the young corpse quite easily to the top."
the-corpse-watchers,"There was the deep sea a quarter of a mile under them, and so the corpse said to her, ""Go home to my mother, and tell her how far you came to do her bidding. Farewell!"""
the-corpse-watchers,"He sprung head-foremost down into the sea, and after him she plunged, without stopping a moment to think about it."
the-corpse-watchers,"She was stupefied at first, but when they reached the waters she recovered her thoughts."
the-corpse-watchers,"After piercing down a great depth, they saw a green light towards the bottom."
the-corpse-watchers,"At last they were below the sea, that seemed a green sky above them; and, sitting in a beautiful meadow, she half-asleep, and her head resting against his side."
the-corpse-watchers,"She couldn't keep her eyes open, and she couldn't tell how long she slept; but when she woke, she was in bed at his house, and he and his mother sitting by her bedside, and watching her."
the-corpse-watchers,"It was a witch that had a spite to the young man because he wouldn't marry her, and so she got power to keep him in a state between life and death till a young woman would rescue him by doing what she had done."
the-corpse-watchers,"So, at her request, her sisters got their own shapes again, and were sent back to their mother, with their spades of gold and shovels of silver."
the-corpse-watchers,"Maybe they were better after that, but I doubt it much."
the-corpse-watchers,The youngest got the young gentleman for her husband.
the-corpse-watchers,"I'm sure she lived happy, and, if they didn't live happy--that we may!"
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"There was once a little page-boy, who was in service in a stately Castle."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He was a very good-natured little fellow, and did his duties so willingly and well that everybody liked him, from the great Earl whom he served every day on bended knee, to the fat old butler whose errands he ran."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"Now the Castle stood on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea, and although the walls at that side were very thick, in them there was a little postern door, which opened on to a narrow flight of steps that led down the face of the cliff to the sea shore, so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in the shimmering sea."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"On the other side of the Castle were gardens and pleasure grounds, opening on to a long stretch of heather-covered moorland, which, at last, met a distant range of hills."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"The little page-boy was very fond of going out on this moor when his work was done, for then he could run about as much as he liked, chasing bumble-bees, and catching butterflies, and looking for birds' nests when it was nesting time."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And the old butler was very pleased that he should do so, for he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the open air."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,But before the boy went out the old man always gave him one warning.
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"""Now, mind my words, laddie, and keep far away from the Fairy Knowe, for the Little Folk are not to trust to."""
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"This Knowe of which he spoke was a little green hillock, which stood on the moor not twenty yards from the garden gate, and folk said that it was the abode of Fairies, who would punish any rash mortal who came too near them."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And because of this the country people would walk a good half-mile out of their way, even in broad daylight, rather than run the risk of going too near the Fairy Knowe and bringing down the Little Folks' displeasure upon them."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And at night they would hardly cross the moor at all, for everyone knows that Fairies come abroad in the darkness, and the door of their dwelling stands open, so that any luckless mortal who does not take care may find himself inside."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"Now, the little page-boy was an adventurous wight, and instead of being frightened of the Fairies, he was very anxious to see them, and to visit their abode, just to find out what it was like."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"So one night, when everyone else was asleep, he crept out of the Castle by the little postern door, and stole down the stone steps, and along the sea shore, and up on to the moor, and went straight to the Fairy Knowe."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,To his delight he found that what everyone said was true.
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"The top of the Knowe was tipped up, and from the opening that was thus made, rays of light came streaming out."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"His heart was beating fast with excitement, but, gathering his courage, he stooped down and slipped inside the Knowe."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He found himself in a large room lit by numberless tiny candles, and there, seated round a polished table, were scores of the Tiny Folk, Fairies, and Elves, and Gnomes, dressed in green, and yellow, and pink; blue, and lilac, and scarlet; in all the colours, in fact, that you can think of."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene in wonder, thinking how strange it was that there should be such a number of these tiny beings living their own lives all unknown to men, at such a little distance from them, when suddenly someone--he could not tell who it was--gave an order."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"""Fetch the Cup,"" cried the owner of the unknown voice, and instantly two little Fairy pages, dressed all in scarlet livery, darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock, and returned staggering under the weight of a most beautiful silver cup, richly embossed and lined inside with gold."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He placed it in the middle of the table, and, amid clapping of hands and shouts of joy, all the Fairies began to drink out of it in turn."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And the page could see, from where he stood, that no one poured wine into it, and yet it was always full, and that the wine that was in it was not always the same kind, but"
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"that each Fairy, when he grasped its stem, wished for the wine that he loved best, and lo! in a moment the cup was full of it."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"""Twould be a fine thing if I could take that cup home with me,"" thought the page."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"""No one will believe that I have been here except I have something to show for it."""
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"So he bided his time, and watched."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"Presently the Fairies noticed him, and, instead of being angry at his boldness in entering their abode, as he expected that they would be, they seemed very pleased to see him, and invited him to a seat at the table."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"But by and by they grew rude and insolent, and jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals, telling him that they saw everything that went on at the Castle, and making fun of the old butler, whom the page loved with all his heart."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And they laughed at the food he ate, saying that it was only fit for animals; and when any fresh dainty was set on the table by the scarlet-clad pages, they would push the dish across to him, saying: ""Taste it, for you will not have the chance of tasting such things at the Castle."""
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"At last he could stand their teasing remarks no longer; besides, he knew that if he wanted to secure the cup he must lose no time in doing so."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"So he suddenly stood up, and grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"""I'll drink to you all in water,"" he cried, and instantly the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He raised the cup to his lips, but he did not drink from it."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"With a sudden jerk he threw the water over the candles, and instantly the room was in darkness."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"Then, clasping the precious cup tightly in his arms, he sprang to the opening of the Knowe, through which he could see the stars glimmering clearly."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He was just in time, for it fell to with a crash behind him; and soon he was speeding along the wet, dew-spangled moor, with the whole troop of Fairies at his heels."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"They were wild with rage, and from the shrill shouts of fury which they uttered, the page knew well that, if they overtook him, he need expect no mercy at their hands."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And his heart began to sink, for, fleet of foot though he was, he was no match for the Fairy Folk, who gained on him steadily."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"All seemed lost, when a mysterious voice sounded out of the darkness: ""If you would gain the Castle door, Keep to the black stones on the shore."""
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"It was the voice of some poor mortal, who, for some reason or other, had been taken prisoner by the Fairies--who were really very malicious Little Folk--and who did not want a like fate to befall the adventurous page-boy; but the little fellow did not know this."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"He had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands, where the waves had come over them, the Fairies could not touch him, and this mysterious sentence brought the saying into his mind."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"So he turned, and dashed panting down to the shore."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"His feet sank in the dry sand, his breath came in little gasps, and he felt as if he must give up the struggle; but he persevered, and at last, just as the foremost Fairies were about to lay hands on him, he jumped across the water-mark on to the firm, wet sand, from which the waves had just receded, and then he knew that he was safe."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"For the Little Folk could go no step further, but stood on the dry sand uttering cries of rage and disappointment, while the triumphant page-boy ran safely along the shore, his precious cup in his arms, and climbed lightly up the steps in the rock and disappeared through the postern."
the-page-boy-and-the-silver-goblet,"And for many years after, long after the little page-boy had grown up and become a stately butler, who trained other little page-boys to follow in his footsteps, the beautiful cup remained in the Castle as a witness of his adventure."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Long, long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old man was a good, kind-hearted, hard-working old fellow, but his wife was a regular cross-patch, who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue."
tongue-cut-sparrow,She was always grumbling about something from morning to night.
tongue-cut-sparrow,The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He was out most of the day at work in the fields, and as he had no child, for his amusement when he came home, he kept a tame sparrow."
tongue-cut-sparrow,He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"When he came back at night after his hard day's work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow, to talk to her and to teach her little tricks, which she learned very quickly."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room, and they would play together."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then when supper-time came, he always saved some tit-bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest, and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The day before, she had made some starch, and now when she came to look for it, it was all gone; the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"While she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch, down flew the pet sparrow, and bowing her little feathered head-a trick which she had been taught by her master-the pretty bird chirped and said: ""It is I who have taken the starch. I thought it was some food put out for me in that basin, and I ate it all. If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me! tweet, tweet, tweet!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"You see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird, and the old woman ought to have been willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely."
tongue-cut-sparrow,But not so.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman had never loved the sparrow, and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping what she called a dirty bird about the house, saying that it only made extra work for her."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"She scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior, and not content with using these harsh, unfeeling words, in a fit of rage she seized the sparrow-who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman, to show how sorry she was-and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird's tongue."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""I suppose you took my starch with that tongue! Now you may see what it is like to go without it!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"And with these dreadful words she drove the bird away, not caring in the least what might happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering, so unkind was she!"
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman, after she had driven the sparrow away, made some more rice-paste, grumbling all the time at the trouble, and after starching all her clothes, spread the things on boards to dry in the sun, instead of ironing them as they do in England."
tongue-cut-sparrow,In the evening the old man came home.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"As usual, on the way back he looked forward to the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him, ruffling out her feathers to show her joy, and at last coming to rest on his shoulder."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"But to-night the old man was very disappointed, for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He quickened his steps, hastily drew off his straw sandals, and stepped on to the veranda."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Still no sparrow was to be seen.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He now felt sure that his wife, in one of her cross tempers, had shut the sparrow up in its cage."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"So he called her and said anxiously: ""Where is Suzume San (Miss Sparrow) today?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman pretended not to know at first, and answered: ""Your sparrow? I am sure I don't know. Now I come to think of it, I haven't seen her all the afternoon. I shouldn't wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all your petting!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"But at last, when the old man gave her no peace, but asked her again and again, insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet, she confessed all."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"She told him crossly how the sparrow had eaten the rice-paste she had specially made for starching her clothes, and how when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done, in great anger she had taken her scissors and cut out her tongue, and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return to the house again."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then the old woman showed her husband the sparrow's tongue, saying: ""Here is the tongue I cut off! Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""How could you be so cruel? Oh! how could you so cruel?"" was all that the old man could answer."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He was too kind-hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife, but he was terribly distressed at what had happened to his poor little sparrow."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""What a dreadful misfortune for my poor Suzume San to lose her tongue!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,he said to himself.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""She won't be able to chirp any more, and surely the pain of the cutting of it out in that rough way must have made her ill! Is there nothing to be done?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,The old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"While he wiped away the tears with the sleeve of his cotton robe, a bright thought comforted him: he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The next morning he rose early, as soon as ever the day broke, and snatching a hasty breakfast, started out over the hills and through the woods, stopping at every clump of bamboos to cry: "" Where, oh where does my tongue-cut sparrow stay? Where, oh where, does my tongue-cut sparrow stay!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He never stopped to rest for his noonday meal, and it was far on in the afternoon when he found himself near a large bamboo wood."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Bamboo groves are the favorite haunts of sparrows, and there sure enough at the edge of the wood he saw his own dear sparrow waiting to welcome him."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He could hardly believe his eyes for joy, and ran forward quickly to greet her."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"She bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her, to show her pleasure at seeing her old friend again, and, wonderful to relate, she could talk as of old."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old man told her how sorry he was for all that had happened, and inquired after her tongue, wondering how she could speak so well without it."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then the sparrow opened her beak and showed him that a new tongue had grown in place of the old one, and begged him not to think any more about the past, for she was quite well now."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy, and no common bird."
tongue-cut-sparrow,It would be difficult to exaggerate the old man's rejoicing now.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He forgot all his troubles, he forgot even how tired he was, for he had found his lost sparrow, and instead of being ill and without a tongue as he had feared and expected to find her, she was well and happy and with a new tongue, and without a sign of the ill-treatment she had received from his wife."
tongue-cut-sparrow,And above all she was a fairy.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The sparrow asked him to follow her, and flying before him she led him to a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove."
tongue-cut-sparrow,The old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house to find what a beautiful place it was.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"It was built of the whitest wood, the soft cream-colored mats which took the place of carpets were the finest he had ever seen, and the cushions that the sparrow brought out for him to sit on were made of the finest silk and crape."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Beautiful vases and lacquer boxes adorned the tokonoma of every room.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The sparrow led the old man to the place of honor, and then, taking her place at a humble distance, she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then the Lady Sparrow, as we will now call her, introduced all her family to the old man."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"This done, her daughters, robed in dainty crape gowns, brought in on beautiful old-fashioned trays a feast of all kinds of delicious foods, till the old man began to think he must be dreaming."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"In the middle of the dinner some of the sparrow's daughters performed a wonderful dance, called the ""suzume-odori"" or the ""Sparrow's dance,"" to amuse the guest."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Never had the old man enjoyed himself so much.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot, with all these fairy sparrows to wait upon him and to feast him and to dance before him."
tongue-cut-sparrow,But the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think about taking his leave and return home.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He thanked his kind hostess for her splendid entertainment, and begged her for his sake to forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife."
tongue-cut-sparrow,He told the Lady Sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing.
tongue-cut-sparrow,It was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her.
tongue-cut-sparrow,Now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart.
tongue-cut-sparrow,If ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The Lady Sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change, but the old man said he must return to his old wife-who would probably be cross at his not coming home at the usual time-and to his work, and there-fore, much as he wished to do so, he could not accept her kind invitation."
tongue-cut-sparrow,But now that he knew where the Lady Sparrow lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"When the Lady Sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer, she gave an order to some of her servants, and they at once brought in two boxes, one large and the other small."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"These were placed before the old man, and the Lady Sparrow asked him to choose whichever he liked for a present, which she wished to give him."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old man could not refuse this kind proposal, and he chose the smaller box, saying: ""I am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box. As you are so kind as to say that I may take whichever I like, I will choose the small one, which will be easier for me to carry."""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off, bidding him good-by with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Thus the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily, the sparrow showing not the least ill-will for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Indeed, she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"When the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual, for it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""Where have you been all this time?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,she asked in a big voice.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""Why do you come back so late?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him, and then he told her of all that had happened to him, and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrow's house."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""Now let us see what is in the box,"" said the old man, not giving her time to grumble again."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""You must help me open it."""
tongue-cut-sparrow,And they both sat down before the box and opened it.
tongue-cut-sparrow,To their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things.
tongue-cut-sparrow,The mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as they took out the things one by one and put them down and handled them over and over again.
tongue-cut-sparrow,The old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Beyond his brightest expectations was the sparrow's gift, which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"He said: ""Thanks to my good little sparrow! Thanks to my good little sparrow!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,many times.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"But the old woman, after the first moments of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the gold and silver were over, could not suppress the greed of her wicked nature."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"She now began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents, for in the innocence of his heart he had told her how he had refused the large box of presents which the sparrows had offered him, preferring the smaller one because it was light and easy to carry home."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""You silly old man,"" said she, ""Why did you not bring the large box? Just think what we have lost. We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this. You are certainly an old fool!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"she screamed, and then went to bed as angry as she could be."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box, but it was too late; the greedy old woman, not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them and which she so little deserved, made up her mind, if possible, to get more."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow's house.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"When he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going, but it was useless."
tongue-cut-sparrow,She would not listen to one word he said.
tongue-cut-sparrow,It is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage.
tongue-cut-sparrow,But her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"It did not even enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with her-as, indeed, they were-and might punish her for what she had done."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Ever since the Lady Sparrow had returned home in the sad plight in which they had first found her, weeping and bleeding from the mouth, her whole family and relations had done little else but speak of the cruelty of the old woman."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"""How could she,"" they asked each other, ""inflict such a heavy punishment for such a trifling offense as that of eating some rice-paste by mistake?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"They all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles, but the old woman they hated, and they determined, if ever they had the chance, to punish her as she deserved."
tongue-cut-sparrow,They had not long to wait.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"After walking for some hours the old woman had at last found the bamboo grove which she had made her husband carefully describe, and now she stood before it crying out: ""Where is the tongue-cut sparrow's house? Where is the tongue-cut sparrow's house?"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,At last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage.
tongue-cut-sparrow,She hastened to the door and knocked loudly.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"When the servants told the Lady Sparrow that her old mistress was at the door asking to see her, she was somewhat surprised at the unexpected visit, after all that had taken place, and she wondered not a little at the boldness of the old woman in venturing to come to the house."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The Lady Sparrow, however, was a polite bird, and so she went out to greet the old woman, remembering that she had once been her mistress."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman intended, however, to waste no time in words, she went right to the point, without the least shame, and said: ""You need not trouble to entertain me as you did my old man. I have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind. I shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big box-that is all I want!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The Lady Sparrow at once consented, and told her servants to bring out the big box."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back, and without even stopping to thank the Lady Sparrow began to hurry homewards."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The box was so heavy that she could not walk fast, much less run, as she would have liked to do, so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box, but she had often to sit down and rest herself by the way."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"While she was staggering along under the heavy load, her desire to open the box became too great to be resisted."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"She could wait no longer, for she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"At last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully, expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"What she saw, however, so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"As soon as she lifted the lid, a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her."
tongue-cut-sparrow,Not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much-coveted box contained.
tongue-cut-sparrow,"A demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her, monsters with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her, a huge snake coiled and hissed about her, and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman had never been so frightened in her life, and ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her, glad to escape alive."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"When she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her, and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box."
tongue-cut-sparrow,"Then she began to blame the sparrow, but the old man stopped her at once, saying: ""Don't blame the sparrow, it is your wickedness which has at last met with its reward. I only hope this may be a lesson to you in the future!"""
tongue-cut-sparrow,"The old woman said nothing more, and from that day she repented of her cross, unkind ways, and by degrees became a good old woman, so that her husband hardly knew her to be the same person, and they spent their last days together happily, free from want or care, spending carefully the treasure the old man had received from his pet, the tongue-cut sparrow."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess, but she could not marry anyone, because she was under an enchantment."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"So the King set out to seek a fairy, and asked what he could do to win the Princess's love."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Fairy said to him: ""You know that the Princess has a great cat which she is very fond of. Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat's tail is the man she is destined to marry."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult, and he left the Fairy, determined to grind the cat's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"You may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the Princess, and puss, as usual, marched in before him, arching his back."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The King took a long step, and quite thought he had the tail under his foot, but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"And so it went on for eight days, till the King began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver-it was never still for a moment."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"At last, however, he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"So the King, without losing a moment, set his foot upon it heavily."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man, who, fixing his angry eyes upon the King, said: ""You shall marry the Princess because you have been able to break the enchantment, but I will have my revenge. You shall have a son, who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you ever tell anyone what I have just said to you, you shall vanish away instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter, he could not help laughing at this threat."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""If my son has such a long nose as that,"" he said to himself, ""he must always see it or feel it; at least, if he is not blind or without hands."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not waste any more time in thinking, but went to seek the Princess, who very soon consented to marry him."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"But after all, they had not been married very long when the King died, and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little son, who was called Hyacinth."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The little Prince had large blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas!"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face.
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked; that it was a Roman nose, and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they told her, and when she looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Prince was brought up with great care; and, as soon as he could speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with the Queen, took to pulling their babies' noses several times every day to make them grow long."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"But, do what they would, they were nothing by comparison with the Prince's."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"When he grew sensible he learned history; and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"His room was hung with pictures, all of people with very large noses; and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty, that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter!"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time that he should be married, so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess!"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"Now, she was the daughter of a great king, and would some day possess several kingdoms herself; but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort, he was so much struck with her beauty."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a little saucy nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think; but this did not do at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the Dear Little Princess's tiny nose!"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still, a woman's beauty was a different thing; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a ""tip-tilted"" nose!"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in marriage."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The King, her father, gave his consent; and Prince Hyacinth, who, in his anxiety to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror of all who stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning, and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess, whirled her away out of their sight!"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again, and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his horse and rode sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"So it happened that he came presently to a great plain, across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house, and horse and rider were terribly hungry, when, as the night fell, the Prince caught sight of a light, which seemed to shine from a cavern."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"He rode up to it, and saw a little old woman, who appeared to be at least a hundred years old."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth, but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Prince and the Fairy (for that was who she was) had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter, and cried at the same moment, ""Oh, what a funny nose!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Not so funny as your own,"" said Prince Hyacinth to the Fairy; ""but, madam, I beg you to leave the consideration of our noses-such as they are-and to be good enough to give me something to eat, for I am starving, and so is my poor horse."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""With all my heart,"" said the Fairy."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Though your nose is so ridiculous you are, nevertheless, the son of my best friend. I loved your father as if he had been my brother. Now he had a very handsome nose!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""And pray what does mine lack?"" said the Prince."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Oh! it doesn't lack anything,"" replied the Fairy."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""On the contrary quite, there is only too much of it. But never mind, one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long. I was telling you that I was your father's friend; he often came to see me in the old times, and you must know that I was very pretty in those days; at least, he used to say so. I should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time I ever saw him."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Indeed,"" said the Prince, ""when I have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it; but consider, madam, I beg of you, that I have had nothing to eat to-day."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""The poor boy is right,"" said the Fairy; ""I was forgetting. Come in, then, and I will give you some supper, and while you are eating I can tell you my story in a very few words- for I don't like endless tales myself. Too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose, and I remember when I was young that I was so much admired for not being a great chatterer. They used to tell the Queen, my mother, that it was so. For though you see what I am now, I was the daughter of a great king. My father--"" ""Your father, I dare say, got something to eat when he was hungry!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,interrupted the Prince.
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Oh! certainly,"" answered the Fairy, ""and you also shall have supper directly. I only just wanted to tell you--"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""But I really cannot listen to anything until I have had something to eat,"" cried the Prince, who was getting quite angry; but then, remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the Fairy's help, he added: ""I know that in the pleasure of listening to you I should quite forget my own hunger; but my horse, who cannot hear you, must really be fed!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment, and said, calling to her servants: ""You shall not wait another minute, you are so polite, and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Plague take the old lady! How she does go on about my nose!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,said the Prince to himself.
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""One would almost think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers lacks! If I were not so hungry I would soon have done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little! How stupid people are not to see their own faults! That comes of being a princess: she has been spoiled by flatterers, who have made her believe that she is quite a moderate talker!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table, and the prince was much amused to hear the Fairy who asked them a thousand questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak; especially he noticed one maid who, no matter what was being said, always contrived to praise her mistress's wisdom."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Well!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"he thought, as he ate his supper, ""I'm very glad I came here. This just shows me how sensible I have been in never listening to flatterers. People of that sort praise us to our faces without shame, and hide our faults or change them into virtues. For my part I never will be taken in by them. I know my own defects, I hope."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,Poor Prince Hyacinth!
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"He really believed what he said, and hadn't an idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him, just as the Fairy's maid was laughing at her; for the Prince had seen her laugh slyly when she could do so without the Fairy's noticing her."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"However, he said nothing, and presently, when his hunger began to be appeased, the Fairy said:"
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a little more that way, for your nose casts such a shadow that I really cannot see what I have on my plate. Ah! thanks. Now let us speak of your father. When I went to his Court he was only a little boy, but that is forty years ago, and I have been in this desolate place ever since. Tell me what goes on nowadays; are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever? In my time one saw them at parties, theatres, balls, and promenades every day. Dear me! what a long nose you have! I cannot get used to it!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Really, madam,"" said the Prince, ""I wish you would leave off mentioning my nose. It cannot matter to you what it is like. I am quite satisfied with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. One must take what is given one."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"""Now you are angry with me, my poor Hyacinth,"" said the Fairy, ""and I assure you that I didn't mean to vex you; on the contrary, I wished to do you a service. However, though I really cannot help your nose being a shock to me, I will try not to say anything about it. I will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose. To tell the truth, it would make three reasonable ones."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew so impatient at the Fairy's continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily away."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"But wherever he came in his journeyings he thought the people were mad, for they all talked of his nose, and yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long, he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy, at last hit upon a plan."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"She shut the Dear Little Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put this palace down where the Prince would not fail to find it."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"His joy at seeing the Princess again was extreme, and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"In despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part, stretched out her hand that he might kiss it; but turn which way he might, he never could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always prevented it."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"For the first time he realized how long it really was, and exclaimed: ""Well, it must be admitted that my nose is too long!"""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"In an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters, and the old Fairy, taking the Dear Little Princess by the hand, said to the Prince: ""Now, say if you are not very much obliged to me. Much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose! You would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it hadn't hindered you from doing what you wanted to. You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body. Our reason tries in vain to show them to us; we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests."""
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just like anyone's else, did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received."
prince-hyacinth-and-thedear-little-princess,"He married the Dear Little Princess, and they lived happily ever after."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"There stands in the university town of Schonen, the town of Lund, the seat of the first archbishopric in all Scandinavia, a stately Romanic minster, with a large, handsome crypt beneath the choir."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"The opinion is universal that the minster will never be altogether finished, but that something will always be lacking about the structure."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"The reason is said to be as follows: When St. Lawrence came to Lund to preach the Gospel, he wanted to build a church; but did not know how he was to obtain the means to do so."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"While he was cudgelling his brains about it, a giant came to him and offered to build the church on condition that St. Lawrence tell him his name before the church was completed."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"But should St. Lawrence be unable to do so, the giant was to receive either the sun, the moon or St. Lawrence's eyes."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,The saint agreed to his proposal.
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"The building of the church made rapid progress, and ere long it was nearly finished."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"St. Lawrence thought ruefully about his prospects, for he did not know the giant's name; yet at the same time he did not relish losing his eyes."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"And it happened that while he was walking without the town, much concerned about the outcome of the affair, he grew weary, and sat down on a hill to rest."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"As he sat there he heard a child crying within the hill, and a woman's voice began to sing: ""Sleep, sleep, my baby dear, To-morrow your father, Finn, will be here; Then sun and moon you shall have from the skies To play with, or else St. Lawrence's eyes."""
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,When St. Lawrence heard that he was happy; for now he knew the giant's name.
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"He ran back quickly to town, and went to the church."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"There sat the giant on the roof, just about to set the last stone in place, when at that very moment the saint called out: ""Finn, Finn, Take care how you put the stone in!"""
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"Then the giant flung the stone from him, full of rage, said that the church should never be finished, and with that he disappeared."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,Since then something has always been missing from the church.
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"Others say that the giant and his wife rushed down into the crypt in their rage, and each seizing a column were about to tear down the church, when they were turned into stone, and may be seen to this day standing beside the columns they had grasped."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,Once upon a time there was a proud prince who had a daughter.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,But the daughter was a child of ill luck.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"When it came time for her to marry, she had all her suitors assemble before her father's palace."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"She was going to throw down a ball of red silk among them, and whoever caught it was to be her husband."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"Now there were many princes and counts gathered before the castle, and in their midst there was also a beggar."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"And the princess could see dragons crawling into his ears and crawling out again from his nostrils, for he was a child of luck."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,So she threw the ball to the beggar and he caught it.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"Her father asked angrily: ""Why did you throw the ball into the beggar's hands?"""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""He is a favorite of Fortune,"" said the princess, ""I will marry him, and then, perhaps, I will share in his good luck."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"But her father would not hear of it, and since she insisted, he drove her from the castle in his rage."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,So the princess had to go off with the beggar.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"She dwelt with him in a little hut, and had to hunt for herbs and roots, and cook them herself, so that they might have something to eat; and often they both went hungry."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"One day her husband said to her: ""I will set out and seek my fortune. And when I have found it, I will come back again and fetch you."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"The princess was willing, and he went away, and was gone for eighteen years."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"Meanwhile the princess lived in want and affliction, for her father remained hard and merciless."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"If her mother had not secretly given her food and money, no doubt she would have starved to death during all that time."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"But the beggar found his fortune, and at length became emperor."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,He returned and stood before his wife.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"She however, no longer recognized him: She only knew that he was the powerful emperor."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,He asked her how she were getting along.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""Why do you ask me how I am getting along?"""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,she replied.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""I am too far beneath your notice."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""And who may your husband be!"""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""My husband was a beggar. He went away to seek his fortune. That was eighteen years ago, and he has not yet returned."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""And what have you done during all those long years?"""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""I have been waiting for him to return."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""Do you wish to marry some one else, seeing that he has been missing so long?"""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""No, I will remain his wife until I die."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"When the emperor saw how faithful his wife was, he told her who he was, had her clothed in magnificent garments, and took her with him to his imperial palace."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,And there they lived in splendor and happiness.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"After a few days the emperor said to his wife: ""We spend every day in festivities, as though every day were New Year."""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"""And why should we not celebrate,"" answered his wife, ""since we have now become emperor and empress?"""
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,Yet his wife was a child of ill luck.
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,"When she had been empress no more than eighteen days, she fell sick and died."
the-favorite-of-fortune-and-the-child-of-ill-luck,But her husband lived for many a long year.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"In far bygone days, in the North, there lived a well-to-do farmer, who had seven sons and one daughter."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And the youngest of these seven sons bore a very curious name; for men called him Assipattle, which means, ""He who grovels among the ashes."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Perhaps Assipattle deserved his name, for he was rather a lazy boy, who never did any work on the farm as his brothers did, but ran about the doors with ragged clothes and unkempt hair, and whose mind was ever filled with wondrous stories of Trolls and Giants, Elves and Goblins."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"When the sun was hot in the long summer afternoons, when the bees droned drowsily and even the tiny insects seemed almost asleep, the boy was content to throw himself down on the ash-heap amongst the ashes, and lie there, lazily letting them run through his fingers, as one might play with sand on the sea-shore, basking in the sunshine and telling stories to himself."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And his brothers, working hard in the fields, would point to him with mocking fingers, and laugh, and say to each other how well the name suited him, and of how little use he was in the world."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And when they came home from their work, they would push him about and tease him, and even his mother would make him sweep the floor, and draw water from the well, and fetch peats from the peat-stack, and do all the little odd jobs that nobody else would do."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So poor Assipattle had rather a hard life of it, and he would often have been very miserable had it not been for his sister, who loved him dearly, and who would listen quite patiently to all the stories that he had to tell; who never laughed at him or told him that he was telling lies, as his brothers did."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But one day a very sad thing happened--at least, it was a sad thing for poor Assipattle."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For it chanced that the King of these parts had one only daughter, the Princess Gemdelovely, whom he loved dearly, and to whom he denied nothing."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And Princess Gemdelovely was in want of a waiting-maid, and as she had seen Assipattle's sister standing by the garden gate as she was riding by one day, and had taken a fancy to her, she asked her father if she might ask her to come and live at the Castle and serve her."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Her father agreed at once, as he always did agree to any of her wishes; and sent a messenger in haste to the farmer's house to ask if his daughter would come to the Castle to be the Princess's waiting-maid."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And, of course, the farmer was very pleased at the piece of good fortune which had befallen the girl, and so was her mother, and so were her six brothers, all except poor Assipattle, who looked with wistful eyes after his sister as she rode away, proud of her new clothes and of the rivlins which her father had made her out of cowhide, which she was to wear in the Palace when she waited on the Princess, for at home she always ran barefoot."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Time passed, and one day a rider rode in hot haste through the country bearing the most terrible tidings."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For the evening before, some fishermen, out in their boats, had caught sight of the Mester Stoorworm, which, as everyone knows, was the largest, and the first, and the greatest of all Sea-Serpents."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"It was that beast which, in the Good Book, is called the Leviathan, and if it had been measured in our day, its tail would have touched Iceland, while its snout rested on the North Cape."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And the fishermen had noticed that this fearsome Monster had its head turned towards the mainland, and that it opened its mouth and yawned horribly, as if to show that it was hungry, and that, if it were not fed, it would kill every living thing upon the land, both man and beast, bird and creeping thing."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,For it was well known that its breath was so poisonous that it consumed as with a burning fire everything that it lighted on.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So that, if it pleased the awful creature to lift its head and put forth its breath, like noxious vapour, over the country, in a few weeks the fair land would be turned into a region of desolation."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"As you may imagine, everyone was almost paralysed with terror at this awful calamity which threatened them; and the King called a solemn meeting of all his Counsellors, and asked them if they could devise any way of warding off the danger."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And for three whole days they sat in Council, these grave, bearded men, and many were the suggestions which were made, and many the words of wisdom which were spoken; but, alas!"
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,no one was wise enough to think of a way by which the Mester Stoorworm might be driven back.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"At last, at the end of the third day, when everyone had given up hope of finding a remedy, the door of the Council Chamber opened and the Queen appeared."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Now the Queen was the King's second wife, and she was not a favourite in the Kingdom, for she was a proud, insolent woman, who did not behave kindly to her step-daughter, the Princess Gemdelovely, and who spent much more of her time in the company of a great Sorcerer, whom everyone feared and dreaded, than she did in that of the King, her husband."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So the sober Counsellors looked at her disapprovingly as she came boldly into the Council Chamber and stood up beside the King's Chair of State, and, speaking in a loud, clear voice, addressed them thus: ""Ye think that ye are brave men and strong, oh, ye Elders, and fit to be the Protectors of the People. And so it may be, when it is mortals that ye are called on to face. But ye be no match for the foe that now threatens our land. Before him your weapons be but as straw. It is not through strength of arm, but through sorcery, that he will be overcome. So listen to my words, even though they be but those of a woman, and take counsel with the great Sorcerer, from whom nothing is hid, but who knoweth all the mysteries of the earth, and of the air, and of the sea."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Now the King and his Counsellors liked not this advice, for they hated the Sorcerer, who had, as they thought, too much influence with the Queen; but they were at their wits' end, and knew not to whom to turn for help, so they were fain to do as she said and summon the Wizard before them."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And when he obeyed the summons and appeared in their midst, they liked him none the better for his looks."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For he was long, and thin, and awesome, with a beard that came down to his knee, and hair that wrapped him about like a mantle, and his face was the colour of mortar, as if he had always lived in darkness, and had been afraid to look on the sun."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But there was no help to be found in any other man, so they laid the case before him, and asked him what they should do."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And he answered coldly that he would think over the matter, and come again to the Assembly the following day and give them his advice."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And his advice, when they heard it, was like to turn their hair white with horror."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For he said that the only way to satisfy the Monster, and to make it spare the land, was to feed it every Saturday with seven young maidens, who must be the fairest who could be found; and if, after this remedy had been tried once or twice, it did not succeed in mollifying the Stoorworm and inducing him to depart, there was but one other measure that he could suggest, but that was so horrible and dreadful that he would not rend their hearts by mentioning it in the meantime."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And as, although they hated him, they feared him also, the Council had e'en to abide by his words, and pronounced the awful doom."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And so it came about that, every Saturday, seven bonnie, innocent maidens were bound hand and foot and laid on a rock which ran into the sea, and the Monster stretched out his long, jagged tongue, and swept them into his mouth; while all the rest of the folk looked on from the top of a high hill--or, at least, the men looked--with cold, set faces, while the women hid theirs in their aprons and wept aloud."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Is there no other way,"" they cried, ""no other way than this, to save the land?"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,But the men only groaned and shook their heads.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""No other way,"" they answered; ""no other way."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,Then suddenly a boy's indignant voice rang out among the crowd.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Is there no grown man who would fight that Monster, and kill him, and save the lassies alive? I would do it; I am not feared for the Mester Stoorworm."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"It was the boy Assipattle who spoke, and everyone looked at him in amazement as he stood staring at the great Sea-Serpent, his fingers twitching with rage, and his great blue eyes glowing with pity and indignation."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""The poor bairn's mad; the sight hath turned his head,"" they whispered one to another; and they would have crowded round him to pet and comfort him, but his elder brother came and gave him a heavy clout on the side of his head."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Thou fight the Stoorworm!"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,he cried contemptuously.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""A likely story! Go home to thy ash-pit, and stop speaking havers;"" and, taking his arm, he drew him to the place where his other brothers were waiting, and they all went home together."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But all the time Assipattle kept on saying that he meant to kill the Stoorworm; and at last his brothers became so angry at what they thought was mere bragging, that they picked up stones and pelted him so hard with them that at last he took to his heels and ran away from them."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"That evening the six brothers were threshing corn in the barn, and Assipattle, as usual, was lying among the ashes thinking his own thoughts, when his mother came out and bade him run and tell the others to come in for their supper."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The boy did as he was bid, for he was a willing enough little fellow; but when he entered the barn his brothers, in revenge for his having run away from them in the afternoon, set on him and pulled him down, and piled so much straw on top of him that, had his father not come from the house to see what they were all waiting for, he would, of a surety, have been smothered."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But when, at supper-time, his mother was quarrelling with the other lads for what they had done, and saying to them that it was only cowards who set on bairns littler and younger than themselves, Assipattle looked up from the bicker of porridge which he was supping."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Vex not thyself, Mother,"" he said, ""for I could have fought them all if I liked; ay, and beaten them, too."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Why didst thou not essay it then?"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,cried everybody at once.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Because I knew that I would need all my strength when I go to fight the Giant Stoorworm,"" replied Assipattle gravely."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And, as you may fancy, the others laughed louder than before."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Time passed, and every Saturday seven lassies were thrown to the Stoorworm, until at last it was felt that this state of things could not be allowed to go on any longer; for if it did, there would soon be no maidens at all left in the country."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So the Elders met once more, and, after long consultation, it was agreed that the Sorcerer should be summoned, and asked what his other remedy was."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""For, by our troth,"" said they, ""it cannot be worse than that which we are practising now."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But, had they known it, the new remedy was even more dreadful than the old."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For the cruel Queen hated her step-daughter, Gemdelovely, and the wicked Sorcerer knew that she did, and that she would not be sorry to get rid of her, and, things being as they were, he thought that he saw a way to please the Queen."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So he stood up in the Council, and, pretending to be very sorry, said that the only other thing that could be done was to give the Princess Gemdelovely to the Stoorworm, then would it of a surety depart."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"When they heard this sentence a terrible stillness fell upon the Council, and everyone covered his face with his hands, for no man dare look at the King."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But although his dear daughter was as the apple of his eye, he was a just and righteous Monarch, and he felt that it was not right that other fathers should have been forced to part with their daughters, in order to try and save the country, if his child was to be spared."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So, after he had had speech with the Princess, he stood up before the Elders, and declared, with trembling voice, that both he and she were ready to make the sacrifice."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""She is my only child,"" he said, ""and the last of her race. Yet it seemeth good to both of us that she should lay down her life, if by so doing she may save the land that she loves so well."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Salt tears ran down the faces of the great bearded men as they heard their King's words, for they all knew how dear the Princess Gemdelovely was to him."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But it was felt that what he said was wise and true, and that the thing was just and right; for it were better, surely, that one maiden should die, even although she were of Royal blood, than that bands of other maidens should go to their death week by week, and all to no purpose."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So, amid heavy sobs, the aged Lawman--he who was the chief man of the Council--rose up to pronounce the Princess's doom."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But, ere he did so, the King's Kemper--or Fighting-man--stepped forward."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Nature teaches us that it is fitting that each beast hath a tail,"" he said; ""and this Doom, which our Lawman is about to pronounce, is in very sooth a venomous beast. And, if I had my way, the tail which it would bear after it is this, that if the Mester Stoorworm doth not depart, and that right speedily, after he have devoured the Princess, the next thing that is offered to him be no tender young maiden, but that tough, lean old Sorcerer."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And at his words there was such a great shout of approval that the wicked Sorcerer seemed to shrink within himself, and his pale face grew paler than it was before."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Now, three weeks were allowed between the time that the Doom was pronounced upon the Princess and the time that it was carried out, so that the King might send Ambassadors to all the neighbouring Kingdoms to issue proclamations that, if any Champion would come forward who was able to drive away the Stoorworm and save the Princess, he should have her for his wife."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And with her he should have the Kingdom, as well as a very famous sword that was now in the King's possession, but which had belonged to the great god Odin, with which he had fought and vanquished all his foes."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The sword bore the name of Sickersnapper, and no man had any power against it."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The news of all these things spread over the length and breadth of the land, and everyone mourned for the fate that was like to befall the Princess Gemdelovely."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And the farmer, and his wife, and their six sons mourned also;--all but Assipattle, who sat amongst the ashes and said nothing."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"When the King's Proclamation was made known throughout the neighbouring Kingdoms, there was a fine stir among all the young Gallants, for it seemed but a little thing to slay a Sea-Monster; and a beautiful wife, a fertile Kingdom, and a trusty sword are not to be won every day."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So six-and-thirty Champions arrived at the King's Palace, each hoping to gain the prize."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But the King sent them all out to look at the Giant Stoorworm lying in the sea with its enormous mouth open, and when they saw it, twelve of them were seized with sudden illness, and twelve of them were so afraid that they took to their heels and ran, and never stopped till they reached their own countries; and so only twelve returned to the King's Palace, and as for them, they were so downcast at the thought of the task that they had undertaken that they had no spirit left in them at all."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And none of them dare try to kill the Stoorworm; so the three weeks passed slowly by, until the night before the day on which the Princess was to be sacrificed."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"On that night the King, feeling that he must do something to entertain his guests, made a great supper for them."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But, as you may think, it was a dreary feast, for everyone was thinking so much about the terrible thing that was to happen on the morrow, that no one could eat or drink."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And when it was all over, and everybody had retired to rest, save the King and his old Kemperman, the King returned to the great hall, and went slowly up to his Chair of State, high up on the dais."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"It was not like the Chairs of State that we know nowadays; it was nothing but a massive Kist, in which he kept all the things which he treasured most."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The old Monarch undid the iron bolts with trembling fingers, and lifted the lid, and took out the wondrous sword Sickersnapper, which had belonged to the great god Odin."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"His trusty Kemperman, who had stood by him in a hundred fights, watched him with pitying eyes."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Why lift ye out the sword,"" he said softly, ""when thy fighting days are done? Right nobly hast thou fought thy battles in the past, oh, my Lord! when thine arm was strong and sure. But when folk's years number four score and sixteen, as thine do, it is time to leave such work to other and younger men."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The old King turned on him angrily, with something of the old fire in his eyes."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Wheest,"" he cried, ""else will I turn this sword on thee. Dost thou think that I can see my only bairn devoured by a Monster, and not lift a finger to try and save her when no other man will? I tell thee--and I will swear it with my two thumbs crossed on Sickersnapper--that both the sword and I will be destroyed before so much as one of her hairs be touched. So go, and thou love me, my old comrade, and order my boat to be ready, with the sail set and the prow pointed out to sea. I will go myself and fight the Stoorworm; and if I do not return, I will lay it on thee to guard my cherished daughter. Peradventure, my life may redeem hers."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Now that night everybody at the farm went to bed betimes, for next morning the whole family was to set out early, to go to the top of the hill near the sea, to see the Princess eaten by the Stoorworm."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"All except Assipattle, who was to be left at home to herd the geese."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,The lad was so vexed at this--for he had great schemes in his head--that he could not sleep.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And as he lay tossing and tumbling about in his corner among the ashes, he heard his father and mother talking in the great box-bed."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And, as he listened, he found that they were having an argument."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Tis such a long way to the hill overlooking the sea, I fear me I shall never walk it,"" said his mother."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""I think I had better bide at home."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Nay,"" replied her husband, ""that would be a bonny-like thing, when all the country-side is to be there. Thou shalt ride behind me on my good mare Go-Swift."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""I do not care to trouble thee to take me behind thee,"" said his wife, ""for methinks thou dost not love me as thou wert wont to do."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""The woman's havering,"" cried the Goodman of the house impatiently."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""What makes thee think that I have ceased to love thee?"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Because thou wilt no longer tell me thy secrets,"" answered his wife."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""To go no further, think of this very horse, Go-Swift. For five long years I have been begging thee to tell me how it is that, when thou ridest her, she flies faster than the wind, while if any other man mount her, she hirples along like a broken-down nag."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,The Goodman laughed.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Twas not for lack of love, Goodwife,"" he said, ""though it might be lack of trust. For women's tongues wag but loosely; and I did not want other folk to ken my secret. But since my silence hath vexed thy heart, I will e'en tell it thee."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""When I want Go-Swift to stand, I give her one clap on the left shoulder. When I would have her go like any other horse, I give her two claps on the right. But when I want her to fly like the wind, I whistle through the windpipe of a goose. And, as I never ken when I want her to gallop like that, I aye keep the bird's thrapple in the left-hand pocket of my coat."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""So that is how thou managest the beast,"" said the farmer's wife, in a satisfied tone; ""and that is what becomes of all my goose thrapples. Oh! but thou art a clever fellow, Goodman; and now that I ken the way of it I may go to sleep."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Assipattle was not tumbling about in the ashes now; he was sitting up in the darkness, with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"His opportunity had come at last, and he knew it."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"He waited patiently till their heavy breathing told him that his parents were asleep; then he crept over to where his father's clothes were, and took the goose's windpipe out of the pocket of his coat, and slipped noiselessly out of the house."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Once he was out of it, he ran like lightning to the stable."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"He saddled and bridled Go-Swift, and threw a halter round her neck, and led her to the stable door."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The good mare, unaccustomed to her new groom, pranced, and reared, and plunged; but Assipattle, knowing his father's secret, clapped her once on the left shoulder, and she stood as still as a stone."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Then he mounted her, and gave her two claps on the right shoulder, and the good horse trotted off briskly, giving a loud neigh as she did so."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The unwonted sound, ringing out in the stillness of the night, roused the household, and the Goodman and his six sons came tumbling down the wooden stairs, shouting to one another in confusion that someone was stealing Go-Swift."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The farmer was the first to reach the door; and when he saw, in the starlight, the vanishing form of his favourite steed, he cried at the top of his voice: ""Stop thief, ho! Go-Swift, whoa!"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,And when Go-Swift heard that she pulled up in a moment.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"All seemed lost, for the farmer and his sons could run very fast indeed, and it seemed to Assipattle, sitting motionless on Go-Swift's back, that they would very soon make up on him."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But, luckily, he remembered the goose's thrapple, and he pulled it out of his pocket and whistled through it."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"In an instant the good mare bounded forward, swift as the wind, and was over the hill and out of reach of its pursuers before they had taken ten steps more."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Day was dawning when the lad came within sight of the sea; and there, in front of him, in the water, lay the enormous Monster whom he had come so far to slay."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Anyone would have said that he was mad even to dream of making such an attempt, for he was but a slim, unarmed youth, and the Mester Stoorworm was so big that men said it would reach the fourth part round the world."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And its tongue was jagged at the end like a fork, and with this fork it could sweep whatever it chose into its mouth, and devour it at its leisure."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For all this, Assipattle was not afraid, for he had the heart of a hero underneath his tattered garments."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""I must be cautious,"" he said to himself, ""and do by my wits what I cannot do by my strength."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"He climbed down from his seat on Go-Swift's back, and tethered the good steed to a tree, and walked on, looking well about him, till he came to a little cottage on the edge of a wood."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The door was not locked, so he entered, and found its occupant, an old woman, fast asleep in bed."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"He did not disturb her, but he took down an iron pot from the shelf, and examined it closely."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""This will serve my purpose,"" he said; ""and surely the old dame would not grudge it if she knew it was to save the Princess's life."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Then he lifted a live peat from the smouldering fire, and went his way."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Down at the water's edge he found the King's boat lying, guarded by a single boatman, with its sails set and its prow turned in the direction of the Mester Stoorworm."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""It's a cold morning,"" said Assipattle."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Art thou not well-nigh frozen sitting there? If thou wilt come on shore, and run about, and warm thyself, I will get into the boat and guard it till thou returnest."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""A likely story,"" replied the man."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""And what would the King say if he were to come, as I expect every moment he will do, and find me playing myself on the sand, and his good boat left to a smatchet like thee? Twould be as much as my head is worth."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""As thou wilt,"" answered Assipattle carelessly, beginning to search among the rocks."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""In the meantime, I must be looking for a wheen mussels to roast for my breakfast."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And after he had gathered the mussels, he began to make a hole in the sand to put the live peat in."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The boatman watched him curiously, for he, too, was beginning to feel hungry."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Presently the lad gave a wild shriek, and jumped high in the air."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Gold, gold!"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,he cried.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""By the name of Thor, who would have looked to find gold here?"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,This was too much for the boatman.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Forgetting all about his head and the King, he jumped out of the boat, and, pushing Assipattle aside, began to scrape among the sand with all his might."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"While he was doing so, Assipattle seized his pot, jumped into the boat, pushed her off, and was half a mile out to sea before the outwitted man, who, needless to say, could find no gold, noticed what he was about."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And, of course, he was very angry, and the old King was more angry still when he came down to the shore, attended by his Nobles and carrying the great sword Sickersnapper, in the vain hope that he, poor feeble old man that he was, might be able in some way to defeat the Monster and save his daughter."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,But to make such an attempt was beyond his power now that his boat was gone.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So he could only stand on the shore, along with the fast assembling crowd of his subjects, and watch what would befall."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,And this was what befell!
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Assipattle, sailing slowly over the sea, and watching the Mester Stoorworm intently, noticed that the terrible Monster yawned occasionally, as if longing for his weekly feast."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And as it yawned a great flood of sea-water went down its throat, and came out again at its huge gills."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"So the brave lad took down his sail, and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the Monster's mouth, and the next time it yawned he and his boat were sucked right in, and, like Jonah, went straight down its throat into the dark regions inside its body."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"On and on the boat floated; but as it went the water grew less, pouring out of the Stoorworm's gills, till at last it stuck, as it were, on dry land."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And Assipattle jumped out, his pot in his hand, and began to explore."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Presently he came to the huge creature's liver, and having heard that the liver of a fish is full of oil, he made a hole in it and put in the live peat."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,Woe's me!
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,but there was a conflagration!
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And Assipattle just got back to his boat in time; for the Mester Stoorworm, in its convulsions, threw the boat right out of its mouth again, and it was flung up, high and dry, on the bare land."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The commotion in the sea was so terrible that the King and his daughter--who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride, in white, ready to be thrown to the Monster--and all his Courtiers, and all the country-folk, were fain to take refuge on the hill top, out of harm's way, and stand and see what happened next."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,And this was what happened next.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The poor, distressed creature--for it was now to be pitied, even although it was a great, cruel, awful Mester Stoorworm--tossed itself to and fro, twisting and writhing."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And as it tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out, and struck the earth with such force that it made a great dent in it, into which the sea rushed."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,And that dent formed the crooked Straits which now divide Denmark from Norway and Sweden.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Then some of its teeth fell out and rested in the sea, and became the Islands that we now call the Orkney Isles; and a little afterwards some more teeth dropped out, and they became what we now call the Shetland Isles."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"After that the creature twisted itself into a great lump and died; and this lump became the Island of Iceland; and the fire which Assipattle had kindled with his live peat still burns on underneath it, and that is why there are mountains which throw out fire in that chilly land."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"When at last it was plainly seen that the Mester Stoorworm was dead, the King could scarce contain himself with joy."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"He put his arms round Assipattle's neck, and kissed him, and called him his son."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And he took off his own Royal Mantle and put it on the lad, and girded his good sword Sickersnapper round his waist."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And he called his daughter, the Princess Gemdelovely, to him, and put her hand in his, and declared that when the right time came she should be his wife, and that he should be ruler over all the Kingdom."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Then the whole company mounted their horses again, and Assipattle rode on Go-Swift by the Princess's side; and so they returned, with great joy, to the King's Palace."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But as they were nearing the gate Assipattle's sister, she who was the Princess's maid, ran out to meet him, and signed to the Princess to lout down, and whispered something in her ear."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"The Princess's face grew dark, and she turned her horse's head and rode back to where her father was, with his Nobles."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"She told him the words that the maiden had spoken; and when he heard them his face, too, grew as black as thunder."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For the matter was this: The cruel Queen, full of joy at the thought that she was to be rid, once for all, of her step-daughter, had been making love to the wicked Sorcerer all the morning in the old King's absence."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""He shall be killed at once,"" cried the Monarch."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Such behaviour cannot be overlooked."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""Thou wilt have much ado to find him, your Majesty,"" said the girl, ""for it is more than an hour since he and the Queen fled together on the fleetest horses that they could find in the stables."""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""But I can find him,"" cried Assipattle; and he went off like the wind on his good horse Go-Swift."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"It was not long before he came within sight of the fugitives, and he drew his sword and shouted to them to stop."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"They heard the shout, and turned round, and they both laughed aloud in derision when they saw that it was only the boy who grovelled in the ashes who pursued them."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"""The insolent brat! I will cut off his head for him! I will teach him a lesson!"""
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,cried the Sorcerer; and he rode boldly back to meet Assipattle.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"For although he was no fighter, he knew that no ordinary weapon could harm his enchanted body; therefore he was not afraid."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"But he did not count on Assipattle having the Sword of the great god Odin, with which he had slain all his enemies; and before this magic weapon he was powerless."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"And, at one thrust, the young lad ran it through his body as easily as if he had been any ordinary man, and he fell from his horse, dead."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"Then the Courtiers of the King, who had also set off in pursuit, but whose steeds were less fleet of foot than Go-Swift, came up, and seized the bridle of the Queen's horse, and led it and its rider back to the Palace."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"She was brought before the Council, and judged, and condemned to be shut up in a high tower for the remainder of her life."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,Which thing surely came to pass.
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,"As for Assipattle, when the proper time came he was married to the Princess Gemdelovely, with great feasting and rejoicing."
assipattle-and-the-mester-stoorworm,And when the old King died they ruled the Kingdom for many a long year.
peerifool,There was once a King and a Queen in Rousay who had three daughters.
peerifool,"When the young Princesses were just grown up, the King died, and the Crown passed to a distant cousin, who had always hated him, and who paid no heed to the widowed Queen and her daughters."
peerifool,"So they were left very badly off, and they went to live in a tiny cottage, and did all the housework themselves."
peerifool,"They had a kailyard in front of the cottage, and a little field behind it, and they had a cow that grazed in the field, and which they fed with the cabbages that grew in the kailyard."
peerifool,For everyone knows that to feed cows with cabbages makes them give a larger quantity of milk.
peerifool,"But they soon discovered that some one was coming at night and stealing the cabbages, and, of course, this annoyed them very much."
peerifool,"For they knew that if they had not cabbages to give to the cow, they would not have enough milk to sell."
peerifool,"So the eldest Princess said she would take out a three-legged stool, and wrap herself in a blanket, and sit in the kailyard all night to see if she could catch the thief."
peerifool,"And, although it was very cold and very dark, she did so."
peerifool,"At first it seemed as if all her trouble would be in vain, for hour after hour passed and nothing happened."
peerifool,"But in the small hours of the morning, just as the clock was striking two, she heard a stealthy trampling in the field behind, as if some very heavy person were trying to tread very softly, and presently a mighty Giant stepped right over the wall into the kailyard."
peerifool,"He carried an enormous creel on his arm, and a large, sharp knife in his hand; and he began to cut the cabbages, and to throw them into the creel as fast as he could."
peerifool,"Now the Princess was no coward, so, although she had not expected to face a Giant, she gathered up her courage, and cried out sharply, ""Who gave thee liberty to cut our cabbages? Leave off this minute, and go away."""
peerifool,"The Giant paid no heed, but went on steadily with what he was doing."
peerifool,"""Do you not hear me?"" cried the girl indignantly; for she was the Princess Royal, and had always been accustomed to be obeyed."
peerifool,"""If you will be not quiet I will take you too,"" said the Giant grimly, pressing the cabbages down into the creel."
peerifool,"""I should like to see you try,"" retorted the Princess, rising from her stool and stamping her foot; for she felt so angry that she forgot for a moment that she was only a weak maiden and he was a great and powerful Giant."
peerifool,"And, as if to show her how strong he was, he seized her by her arm and her leg, and put her in his creel on the top of the cabbages, and carried her away bodily."
peerifool,"When he reached his home, which was in a great square house on a lonely moor, he took her out, and set her down roughly on the floor."
peerifool,"""You will be my servant now,"" he said, ""and keep my house, and do my errands for me. I have a cow, which you must drive out every day to the hillside; and see, here is a bag of wool, when you have taken out the cow, you must come back and settle thyself at home, as a good housewife should, and comb, and card it, and spin it into yarn, with which to weave a good thick cloth for my raiment. I am out most of the day, but when I come home I shall expect to find all this done, and a great bicker of porridge boiled besides for my supper."""
peerifool,"The poor Princess was very dismayed when she heard these words, for she had never been accustomed to work hard, and she had always had her sisters to help her; but the Giant took no notice of her distress, but went out as soon as it was daylight, leaving her alone in the house to begin her work."
peerifool,"As soon as he had gone she drove the cow to the pasture, as he had told her to do; but she had a good long walk over the moor before she reached the hill, and by the time that she got back to the house she felt very tired."
peerifool,"So she thought that she would put on the porridge pot, and make herself some porridge before she began to card and comb the wool."
peerifool,"She did so, and just as she was sitting down to sup them the door opened, and a crowd of wee, wee Peerie Folk came in."
peerifool,"They were the tiniest men and women that the Princess had ever seen; not one of them would have reached half-way to her knee; and they were dressed in dresses fashioned out of all the colours of the rainbow--scarlet and blue, green and yellow, orange and violet; and the funny thing was, that every one of them had a shock of straw-coloured yellow hair."
peerifool,"They were all talking and laughing with one another; and they hopped up, first on stools, then on chairs, till at last they reached the top of the table, where they clustered round the bowl, out of which the Princess was eating her porridge."
peerifool,"""We be hungry, we be hungry,"" they cried, in their tiny shrill voices."
peerifool,"""Spare a little porridge for the Peerie Folk."""
peerifool,"But the Princess was hungry also; and, besides being hungry, she was both tired and cross; so she shook her head and waved them impatiently away with her spoon, ""Little for one, and less for two, And never a grain have I for you."""
peerifool,"she said sharply, and, to her great delight, for she did not feel quite comfortable with all the Peerie Folk standing on the table looking at her, they vanished in a moment."
peerifool,"After this she finished her porridge in peace; then she took the wool out of the bag, and she set to work to comb and card it."
peerifool,"But it seemed as if it were bewitched; it curled and twisted and coiled itself round her fingers so that, try as she would, she could not do anything with it."
peerifool,"And when the Giant came home he found her sitting in despair with it all in confusion round her, and the porridge, which she had left for him in the pot, burned to a cinder."
peerifool,"As you may imagine, he was very angry, and raged, and stamped, and used the most dreadful words; and at last he took her by the heels, and beat her until all her back was skinned and bleeding; then he carried her out to the byre, and threw her up on the joists among the hens."
peerifool,"And, although she was not dead, she was so stunned and bruised that she could only lie there motionless, looking down on the backs of the cows."
peerifool,"Time went on, and in the kailyard at home the cabbages were disappearing as fast as ever."
peerifool,"So the second Princess said that she would do as her sister had done, and wrap herself in a blanket, and go and sit on a three-legged stool all night, to see what was becoming of them."
peerifool,"She did so, and exactly the same fate befell her that had befallen her elder sister."
peerifool,"The Giant appeared with his creel, and he carried her off, and set her to mind the cow and the house, and to make his porridge and to spin; and the little yellow-headed Peerie Folk appeared and asked her for some supper, and she refused to give it to them; and after that, she could not comb or card her wool, and the Giant was angry, and he scolded her, and beat her, and threw her up, half dead, on the joists beside her sister and the hens."
peerifool,"Then the youngest Princess determined to sit out in the kailyard all night, not so much to see what was becoming of the cabbages, as to discover what had happened to her sisters."
peerifool,"And when the Giant came and carried her off, she was not at all sorry, but very glad, for she was a brave and loving little maiden; and now she felt that she had a chance of finding out where they were, and whether they were dead or alive."
peerifool,"So she was quite cheerful and happy, for she felt certain that she was clever enough to outwit the Giant, if only she were watchful and patient; so she lay quite quietly in her creel above the cabbages, but she kept her eyes very wide open to see by which road he was carrying her off."
peerifool,"And when he set her down in his kitchen, and told her all that he expected her to do, she did not look downcast like her sisters, but nodded her head brightly, and said that she felt sure that she could do it."
peerifool,"And she sang to herself as she drove the cow over the moor to pasture, and she ran the whole way back, so that she should have a good long afternoon to work at the wool, and, although she would not have told the Giant this, to search the house."
peerifool,"Before she set to work, however, she made herself some porridge, just as her sisters had done; and, just as she was going to sup them, all the little yellow-haired Peerie Folk trooped in, and climbed up on the table, and stood and stared at her."
peerifool,"""We be hungry, we be hungry,"" they cried."
peerifool,"""Spare a little porridge for the Peerie Folk."""
peerifool,"""With all my heart,"" replied the good-natured Princess."
peerifool,"""If you can find dishes little enough for you to sup out of, I will fill them for you. But, it seems to me, if I were to give you all porringers, you would smother yourselves among the porridge."""
peerifool,"At her words the Peerie Folk shouted with laughter, till their straw-coloured hair tumbled right over their faces; then they hopped on to the floor and ran out of the house, and presently they came trooping back holding cups of blue-bells, and foxgloves, and saucers of primroses and anemones in their hands; and the Princess put a tiny spoonful of porridge into each saucer, and a tiny drop of milk into each cup, and they ate it all up as daintily as possible with neat little grass spoons, which they had brought with them in their pockets."
peerifool,"When they had finished they all cried out, ""Thank you! Thank you!"" and ran out of the kitchen again, leaving the Princess alone."
peerifool,"And, being alone, she went all over the house to look for her sisters, but, of course, she could not find them."
peerifool,"""Never mind, I will find them soon,"" she said to herself."
peerifool,"""To-morrow I will search the byre and the outhouses; in the meantime, I had better get on with my work."""
peerifool,"So she went back to the kitchen, and took out the bag of wool, which the Giant had told her to make into cloth."
peerifool,"But just as she was doing so the door opened once more, and a Yellow-Haired Peerie Boy entered."
peerifool,"He was exactly like the other Peerie Folk who had eaten the Princess's porridge, only he was bigger, and he wore a very rich dress of grass-green velvet."
peerifool,He walked boldly into the middle of the kitchen and looked round him.
peerifool,"""Do you have any work for me to do?"" he asked."
peerifool,"""I know grand how to handle wool and turn it into fine thick cloth."""
peerifool,"""I have plenty of work for anybody who asks it,"" replied the Princess; ""but I have no money to pay for it, and there are but few folk in this world who will work without wages."""
peerifool,"""All the wages that I ask is that tyou will take the trouble to find out my name, for few folk ken it, and few folk care to know. But if by any chance you cannot find it out, then must you pay toll of half of your cloth."""
peerifool,"The Princess thought that it would be quite an easy thing to find out the Boy's name, so she agreed to the bargain, and, putting all the wool back into the bag, she gave it to him, and he swung it over his shoulder and departed."
peerifool,"She ran to the door to see where he went, for she had made up her mind that she would follow him secretly to his home, and find out from the neighbours what his name was."
peerifool,"But, to her great dismay, though she looked this way and that, he had vanished completely, and she began to wonder what she should do if the Giant came back and found that she had allowed someone, whose name she did not even know, to carry off all the wool."
peerifool,"And, as the afternoon wore on, and she could think of no way of finding out who the boy was, or where he came from, she felt that she had made a great mistake, and she began to grow very frightened."
peerifool,"Just as the gloaming was beginning to fall a knock came at the door, and, when she opened it, she found an old woman standing outside, who begged for a night's lodging."
peerifool,"Now, as I have told you, the Princess was very kind-hearted, and she would fain have granted the poor old Dame's request, but she dared not, for she did not know what the Giant would say."
peerifool,"So she told the old woman that she could not take her in for the night, as she was only a servant, and not the mistress of the house; but she made her sit down on a bench beside the door, and brought her out some bread and milk, and gave her some water to bathe her poor, tired feet."
peerifool,"She was so bonnie, and gentle, and kind, and she looked so sorry when she told her that she would need to turn her away, that the old woman gave her her blessing, and told her not to vex herself, as it was a fine, dry night, and now that she had had a meal she could easily sit down somewhere and sleep in the shelter of the outhouses."
peerifool,"And, when she had finished her bread and milk, she went and laid down by the side of a green knowe, which rose out of the moor not very far from the byre door."
peerifool,"And, strange to say, as she lay there she felt the earth beneath her getting warmer and warmer, until she was so hot that she was fain to crawl up the side of the hillock, in the hope of getting a mouthful of fresh air."
peerifool,"And as she got near the top she heard a voice, which seemed to come from somewhere beneath her, saying, ""TEASE, TEASENS, TEASE; CARD, CARDENS, CARD; SPIN, SPINNENS, SPIN; for PEERIFOOL PEERIFOOL, PEERIFOOL is what men call me."""
peerifool,"And when she got to the very top, she found that there was a crack in the earth, through which rays of light were coming; and when she put her eye to the crack, what should she see down below her but a brilliantly lighted chamber, in which all the Peerie Folk were sitting in a circle, working away as hard as they could."
peerifool,"Some of them were carding wool, some of them were combing it, some of them were spinning it, constantly wetting their fingers with their lips, in order to twist the yarn fine as they drew it from the distaff, and some of them were spinning the yarn into cloth."
peerifool,"While round and round the circle, cracking a little whip, and urging them to work faster, was a Yellow-Haired Peerie Boy."
peerifool,"""This is a strange thing, and these be queer on-goings,"" said the old woman to herself, creeping hastily down to the bottom of the hillock again."
peerifool,"""I must e'en go and tell the bonnie lassie in the house yonder. Maybe the knowledge of what I have seen will stand her in good stead some day. When there be Peerie Folk about, it is well to be on one's guard."""
peerifool,"So she went back to the house and told the Princess all that she had seen and heard, and the Princess was so delighted with what she had told her that she risked the Giant's wrath and allowed her to go and sleep in the hayloft."
peerifool,"It was not very long after the old woman had gone to rest before the door opened, and the Peerie Boy appeared once more with a number of webs of cloth upon his shoulder."
peerifool,"""Here is your cloth,"" he said, with a sly smile, ""and I will put it on the shelf for thee the moment that you tell me what my name is."""
peerifool,"Then the Princess, who was a merry maiden, thought that she would tease the little follow for a time ere she let him know that she had found out his secret."
peerifool,"So she mentioned first one name and then another, always pretending to think that she had hit upon the right one; and all the time the Peerie Boy jumped from side to side with delight, for he thought that she would never find out the right name, and that half of the cloth would be his."
peerifool,"But at last the Princess grew tired of joking, and she cried out, with a little laugh of triumph, ""Do you by any chance know anyone called PEERIFOOL, little Mannikin?"""
peerifool,"Then he knew that in some way she had found out what men called him, and he was so angry and disappointed that he flung the webs of cloth down in a heap on the floor, and ran out at the door, slamming it behind him."
peerifool,"Meanwhile the Giant was coming down the hill in the darkening, and, to his astonishment, he met a troop of little Peerie Folk toiling up it, looking as if they were so tired that they could hardly get along."
peerifool,"Their eyes were dim and listless, their heads were hanging on their breasts, and their lips were so long and twisted that the poor little people looked quite hideous."
peerifool,"The Giant asked how this was, and they told him that they had to work so hard all day, spinning for their Master that they were quite exhausted; and that the reason why their lips were so distorted was that they used them constantly to wet their fingers, so that they might pull the wool in very fine strands from the distaff."
peerifool,"""I always thought a great deal of women who could spin,"" said the Giant, ""and I looked out for a housewife that could do so. But after this I will be more careful, for the housewife that I have now is a bonnie little woman, and I would be loth to have her spoil her face in that manner."""
peerifool,And he hurried home in a great state of mind in case he should find that his new servant's pretty red lips had grown long and ugly in his absence.
peerifool,"Great was his relief to see her standing by the table, bonnie and winsome as ever, with all the webs of cloth in a pile in front of her."
peerifool,"""By my truth, you are an industrious maiden,"" he said, in high good humour, ""and, as a reward for working so diligently, I will restore your sisters to you."""
peerifool,"And he went out to the byre, and lifted the two other Princesses down from the rafters, and brought them in and laid them on the settle."
peerifool,"Their little sister nearly screamed aloud when she saw how ill they looked and how bruised their backs were, but, like a prudent maiden, she held her tongue, and busied herself with applying a cooling ointment to their wounds, and binding them up, and by and by her sisters revived, and, after the Giant had gone to bed, they told her all that had befallen them."
peerifool,"""I will be avenged on him for his cruelty,"" said the little Princess firmly; and when she spoke like that her sisters knew that she meant what she said."
peerifool,"So next morning, before the Giant was up, she fetched his creel, and put her eldest sister into it, and covered her with all the fine silken hangings and tapestry that she could find, and on the top of all she put a handful of grass, and when the Giant came downstairs she asked him, in her sweetest tone, if he would do her a favour."
peerifool,"And the Giant, who was very pleased with her because of the quantity of cloth which he thought she had spun, said that he would."
peerifool,"""Then carry that creelful of grass home to my mother's cottage for her cow to eat,"" said the Princess."
peerifool,"""This will help to make up for all the cabbages which you have stolen from her kailyard."""
peerifool,"And, wonderful to relate, the Giant did as he was bid, and carried the creel to the cottage."
peerifool,"Next morning she put her second sister into another creel, and covered her with all the fine napery she could find in the house, and put an armful of grass on the top of it, and at her bidding the Giant, who was really getting very fond of her, carried it also home to her mother."
peerifool,"The next morning the little Princess told him that she thought that she would go for a long walk after she had done her housework, and that she might not be in when he came home at night, but that she would have Another creel of grass ready for him, if he would carry it to the cottage as he had done on the two previous evenings."
peerifool,"He promised to do so; then, as usual, he went out for the day."
peerifool,"In the afternoon the clever little maiden went through the house, gathering together all the lace, and silver, and jewellery that she could find, and brought them and placed them beside the creel."
peerifool,"Then she went out and cut an armful of grass, and brought it in and laid it beside them."
peerifool,"Then she crept into the creel herself, and pulled all the fine things in above her, and then she covered everything up with the grass, which was a very difficult thing to do, seeing she herself was at the bottom of the basket."
peerifool,Then she lay quite still and waited.
peerifool,"Presently the Giant came in, and, obedient to his promise, he lifted the creel and carried it off to the old Queen's cottage."
peerifool,"No one seemed to be at home, so he set it down in the entry, and turned to go away."
peerifool,"But the little Princess had told her sisters what to do, and they had a great can of boiling water ready in one of the rooms upstairs, and when they heard his steps coming round that side of the house, they threw open the window and emptied it all over his head; and that was the end of him."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"In the days of the Emperor Yau lived a prince by the name of Hou I, who was a mighty hero and a good archer."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"Once ten suns rose together in the sky, and shone so brightly and burned so fiercely that the people on earth could not endure them."
the-lady-of-the-moon,So the Emperor ordered Hou I to shoot at them.
the-lady-of-the-moon,And Hou I shot nine of them down from the sky.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"Besides his bow, Hou I also had a horse which ran so swiftly that even the wind could not catch up with it."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"He mounted it to go a-hunting, and the horse ran away and could not be stopped."
the-lady-of-the-moon,So Hou I came to Kunlun Mountain and met the Queen-Mother of the Jasper Sea.
the-lady-of-the-moon,And she gave him the herb of immortality.
the-lady-of-the-moon,He took it home with him and hid it in his room.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"But his wife who was named Tschang O, once ate some of it on the sly when he was not at home, and she immediately floated up to the clouds."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"When she reached the moon, she ran into the castle there, and has lived there ever since as the Lady of the Moon."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"On a night in mid-autumn, an emperor of the Tang dynasty once sat at wine with two sorcerers."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"And one of them took his bamboo staff and cast it into the air, where it turned into a heavenly bridge, on which the three climbed up to the moon together."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"There they saw a great castle on which was inscribed: ""The Spreading Halls of Crystal Cold."""
the-lady-of-the-moon,Beside it stood a cassia tree which blossomed and gave forth a fragrance filling all the air.
the-lady-of-the-moon,And in the tree sat a man who was chopping off the smaller boughs with an ax.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"One of the sorcerers said: ""That is the man in the moon. The cassia tree grows so luxuriantly that in the course of time it would overshadow all the moon's radiance. Therefore it has to be cut down once in every thousand years."""
the-lady-of-the-moon,Then they entered the spreading halls.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"The silver stories of the castle towered one above the other, and its walls and columns were all formed of liquid crystal."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"In the walls were cages and ponds, where fishes and birds moved as though alive."
the-lady-of-the-moon,The whole moon-world seemed made of glass.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"While they were still looking about them on all sides the Lady of the Moon stepped up to them, clad in a white mantle and a rainbow-colored gown."
the-lady-of-the-moon,"She smiled and said to the emperor: ""You are a prince of the mundane world of dust. Great is your fortune, since you have been able to find your way here!"""
the-lady-of-the-moon,"And she called for her attendants, who came flying up on white birds, and sang and danced beneath the cassia tree."
the-lady-of-the-moon,A pure clear music floated through the air.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"Beside the tree stood a mortar made of white marble, in which a jasper rabbit ground up herbs."
the-lady-of-the-moon,That was the dark half of the moon.
the-lady-of-the-moon,"When the dance had ended, the emperor returned to earth again with the sorcerers."
the-lady-of-the-moon,And he had the songs which he had heard on the moon written down and sung to the accompaniment of flutes of jasper in his pear-tree garden.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,Once upon a time there was a man and his wife and they had a ring of gold.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"It was a lucky ring, and whoever owned it always had enough to live on."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"But this they did not know, and hence sold the ring for a small sum."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"But no sooner was the ring gone than they began to grow poorer and poorer, and at last did not know when they would get their next meal."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"They had a dog and a cat, and these had to go hungry as well."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,Then the two animals took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,At length the dog hit upon an idea.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"""They must have the ring back again,"" he said to the cat."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"The cat answered: ""The ring has been carefully locked up in the chest, where no one can get at it."""
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"""You must catch a mouse,"" said the dog, ""and the mouse must gnaw a hole in the chest and fetch out the ring. And if she does not want to, say that you will bite her to death, and you will see that she will do it."""
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"This advice pleased the cat, and she caught a mouse."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"Then she wanted to go to the house in which stood the chest, and the dog came after."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,They came to a broad river.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"And since the cat could not swim, the dog took her on his back and swam across with her."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,Then the cat carried the mouse to the house in which the chest stood.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"The mouse gnawed a hole in the chest, and fetched out the ring."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"The cat put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river, where the dog was waiting for her, and swam across with her."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"Then they started out together for home, in order to bring the lucky ring to their master and mistress."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,But the dog could only run along the ground; when there was a house in the way he always had to go around it.
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"The cat, however, quickly climbed over the roof, and so she reached home long before the dog, and brought the ring to her master."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"Then her master said to his wife: ""What a good creature the cat is! We will always give her enough to eat and care for her as though she were our own child!"""
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"But when the dog came home they beat him and scolded him, because he had not helped to bring home the ring again."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"And the cat sat by the fireplace, purred and said never a word."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,"Then the dog grew angry at the cat, because she had robbed him of his reward, and when he saw her he chased her and tried to seize her."
why-dog-and-cat-are-enemies,And ever since that day cat and dog are enemies.
old-dschang,Once upon a time there was a man who went by the name of Old Dschang.
old-dschang,"He lived in the country, near Yangdschou, as a gardener."
old-dschang,"His neighbor, named Sir We, held an official position in Yangdschou."
old-dschang,"Sir We had decided that it was time for his daughter to marry, so he sent for a match-maker and commissioned her to find a suitable husband."
old-dschang,"Old Dschang heard this, and was pleased."
old-dschang,"He prepared food and drink, entertained the match-maker, and told her to recommend him as a husband."
old-dschang,But the old match-maker went off scolding.
old-dschang,The next day he invited her to dinner again and gave her money.
old-dschang,"Then the old match-maker said: ""You do not know what you wish! Why should a gentleman's beautiful daughter condescend to marry a poor old gardener like yourself? Even though you had money to burn, your white hair would not match her black locks. Such a marriage is out of the question!"""
old-dschang,"But Old Dschang did not cease to entreat her: ""Make an attempt, just one attempt, to mention me! If they will not listen to you, then I must resign myself to my fate!"""
old-dschang,"The old match-maker had taken his money, so she could not well refuse, and though she feared being scolded, she mentioned him to Sir We."
old-dschang,He grew angry and wanted to throw her out of the house.
old-dschang,"""I knew you would not thank me,"" said she, ""but the old man urged it so that I could not refuse to mention his intention."""
old-dschang,"""Tell the old man that if this very day he brings me two white jade-stones, and four hundred ounces of yellow gold, then I will give him my daughter's hand in marriage."""
old-dschang,"But he only wished to mock the old man's folly, for he knew that the latter could not give him anything of the kind."
old-dschang,The match-maker went to Old Dschang and delivered the message.
old-dschang,And he made no objection; but at once brought the exact quantity of gold and jewels to Sir We's house.
old-dschang,"The latter was very much frightened and when his wife heard of it, she began to weep and wail loudly."
old-dschang,"But the girl encouraged her mother: ""My father has given his word now and cannot break it. I will know how to bear my fate."""
old-dschang,So Sir We's daughter was married to Old Dschang.
old-dschang,But even after the wedding the latter did not give up his work as a gardener.
old-dschang,"He spaded the field and sold vegetables as usual, and his wife had to fetch water and build the kitchen fire herself."
old-dschang,"But she did her work without false shame and, though her relatives reproached her, she continued to do so."
old-dschang,"Once an aristocratic relative visited Sir We and said: ""If you had really been poor, were there not enough young gentlemen in the neighborhood for your daughter? Why did you have to marry her to such a wrinkled old gardener? Now that you have thrown her away, so to speak, it would be better if both of them left this part of the country."""
old-dschang,Then Sir We prepared a banquet and invited his daughter and Old Dschang to visit him.
old-dschang,When they had had sufficient to eat and drink he allowed them to get an inkling of what was in his mind.
old-dschang,"Said Old Dschang: ""I have only remained here because I thought you would long for your daughter. But since you are tired of us, I will be glad to go. I have a little country house back in the hills, and we will set out for it early to-morrow morning."""
old-dschang,"The following morning, at break of dawn, Old Dschang came with his wife to say farewell."
old-dschang,"Sir We said: ""Should we long to see you at some later time, my son can make inquiries."""
old-dschang,Old Dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear.
old-dschang,He himself took his staff and walked after.
old-dschang,A few years passed without any news from either of them.
old-dschang,Then Sir We and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries.
old-dschang,When the latter got back in the hills he met a plow-boy who was plowing with two yellow steers.
old-dschang,"He asked him: ""Where is Old Dschang's country house?"""
old-dschang,"The plow-boy left the plow in the harrow, bowed and answered: ""You have been a long time coming, sir! The village is not far from here: I will show you the way."""
old-dschang,They crossed a hill.
old-dschang,"At the foot of the hill flowed a brook, and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill."
old-dschang,Gradually the landscape changed.
old-dschang,"From the top of the hill could be seen a valley, level in the middle, surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees, among which houses and towers peeped forth."
old-dschang,This was the country house of Old Dschang.
old-dschang,"Before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear, blue water."
old-dschang,They passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate.
old-dschang,"Here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion, and peacocks and cranes flew about."
old-dschang,From the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and of stringed instruments.
old-dschang,Crystal-clear tones rose to the clouds.
old-dschang,A messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor.
old-dschang,"Strange fragrances filled the air, and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl."
old-dschang,"Two maid-servants came forth to greet him, followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional."
old-dschang,"After them a man in a flowing turban, clad in scarlet silk, with red slippers, came floating along."
old-dschang,The guest saluted him.
old-dschang,"He was serious and dignified, and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh."
old-dschang,"At first We's son did not recognize him, but when he looked more closely, why it was Old Dschang!"
old-dschang,"The latter said with a smile: ""I am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming. Your sister is just combing her hair. She will welcome you in a moment."""
old-dschang,Then he had him sit down and drink tea.
old-dschang,"After a short time a maid-servant came and led him to the inner rooms, to his sister."
old-dschang,"The beams of her room were of sandalwood, the doors of tortoise-shell and the windows inlaid with blue jade; her curtains were formed of strings of pearls and the steps leading into the room of green nephrite."
old-dschang,"His sister was magnificently gowned, and far more beautiful than before."
old-dschang,"She asked him carelessly how he was getting along, and what her parents were doing; but was not very cordial."
old-dschang,After a splendid meal she had an apartment prepared for him.
old-dschang,"""My sister wishes to make an excursion to the Mountain of the Fairies,"" said Old Dschang to him."
old-dschang,"""We will be back about sunset, and you can rest until we return."""
old-dschang,"Then many-colored clouds rose in the courtyard, and dulcet music sounded on the air."
old-dschang,"Old Dschang mounted a dragon, while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes."
old-dschang,So they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction.
old-dschang,They did not return until after sunset.
old-dschang,"Old Dschang and his wife then said to him: ""This is an abode of the blessed. You cannot remain here overlong. To-morrow we will escort you back."""
old-dschang,"On the following day, when taking leave, Old Dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat."
old-dschang,"""Should you need money,"" said he, ""you can go to Yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old Wang's drug-shop. There you can collect ten million pieces of copper. This hat is the order for them."""
old-dschang,Then he ordered his plow-boy to take him home again.
old-dschang,"Quite a few of the folks at home, to whom he described his adventures, thought that Old Dschang must be a holy man, while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision."
old-dschang,After five or six years Sir We's money came to an end.
old-dschang,So his son took the straw hat to Yangdschou and there asked for old Wang.
old-dschang,"The latter just happened to be standing in his drug-shop, mixing herbs."
old-dschang,"When the son explained his errand he said: ""The money is ready. But is your hat genuine?"""
old-dschang,And he took the hat and examined it.
old-dschang,"A young girl came from an inner room and said: ""I wove the hat for Old Dschang myself. There must be a red thread in it."""
old-dschang,"And sure enough, there was."
old-dschang,"Then old Wang gave young We the ten million pieces of copper, and the latter now believed that Old Dschang was really a saint."
old-dschang,So he once more went over the hills to look for him.
old-dschang,"He asked the forest-keepers, but they could tell him naught."
old-dschang,"Sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old Wang, but he had also disappeared."
old-dschang,"When several years had passed he once more came to Yangdschou, and was walking in the meadow before the city gate."
old-dschang,There he met Old Dschang's plow-boy.
old-dschang,"The latter cried out: ""How are you? How are you?"" and drew out ten pounds of gold, which he gave to him, saying: ""My mistress told me to give you this. My master is this very moment drinking tea with old Wang in the inn."""
old-dschang,"Young We followed the plow-boy, intending to greet his brother-in-law."
old-dschang,But when he reached the inn there was no one in sight.
old-dschang,And when he turned around the plow-boy had disappeared as well.
old-dschang,And since that time no one ever heard from Old Dschang again.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"In the old days there lived on a headland that juts out into the northwestern corner of Lake Rasval, in the neighborhood of the Linde mining-district, a charcoal-burner named Nils, generally known as Charcoal Nils."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"He let a farm-hand attend to his little plot of land, and he himself made his home in the forest, where he chopped wood in the summer and burned it to charcoal in the winter."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Yet no matter how hard he struggled, his work was unblessed with reward, and no one ever spoke of him save as poor Charcoal Nils."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"One day, when he was on the opposite shore of the lake, near the gloomy Harsberg, a strange woman came up to him, and asked whether he needed some one to help him with his charcoal burning."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""Yes, indeed,"" said he, ""help would be welcome."""
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"So she began to gather blocks of wood and tree-trunks, more than Charcoal Nils could have dragged together with his horse, and by noon there was enough wood for a new kiln."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"When evening came, she asked the charcoal-burner whether he were satisfied with the day's work she had done, and if she were to come back the next day."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"That suited the charcoal-burner perfectly, and she came back the next day and all the following ones."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"And when the kiln had been burned out she helped Nils clear it, and never before had he had such a quantity of charcoal, nor charcoal of so fine a quality."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,So she became his wife and lived with him in the wood for three years.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"They had three children, yet this worried Nils but little, seeing that she looked after them, and they gave him no trouble."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"But when the fourth year came, she grew more exacting, and insisted on going back to his home with him, and living with him there."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Nils wished to hear nothing about this; yet since she was so useful to him in his charcoal-burning, he did not betray his feelings, and said he would think it over."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"It happened one Sunday that he went to church--where he had not been for many years, and what he heard there brought up thoughts he had not known since the innocent days of his childhood."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"He began to wonder whether there were not some hocus-pocus about the charcoal-burning, and whether it were not due to the forest woman, who aided him so willingly."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Preoccupied with this and other thoughts, he forgot while returning to his kiln, that he had promised the strange woman at the very beginning, when she had first helped him, that, whenever he had been home and was returning to the kiln, he would rap three times with his ax against an old pine-tree not far from it."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"On this occasion, as we have said, he forgot the sign, and as a result he saw something that nearly robbed him of his wits."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"As he drew near the kiln, he saw it all aflame, and around it stood the three children and their mother, and they were clearing out the kiln."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"They were pulling down and putting out so that flames, smoke and ashes whirled sky-high, but instead of the spruce-branches that were generally used to put out the fire, they had bushy tails which they dipped in the snow!"
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"When Charcoal Nils had looked on for a while, he slunk back to the old pine-tree, and made its trunk echo to the sound of his three ax-strokes till one could hear them on the Harsberg."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Then he went to the kiln, as though he had seen nothing, and all went on as before."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"The kiln was glowing with a handsome, even glow, and the tall woman was about and working as usual."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"As soon as she saw Charcoal Nils, she came back with her pressing demand that he take her home to his little house, and that they live there."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""Yes, that shall come about,"" said Nils to console her, and turned back home to fetch a horse."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"But instead he went out on the headline of Kallernas, on the eastern shore of Lake Rasval, where a wise man lived, and asked the latter what he should do."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"The old man advised him to go home and hitch his horse to his charcoal-wagon, but to hitch the horse in such wise that there would be not a single loop either in the harness or traces."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Then he was to mount the horse and ride back to the kiln without stopping, have the troll-woman and her children get into the wagon, and at once drive out on the ice with them."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"The charcoal-burner did as the old man told him, saddled his horse, paying strict attention that there were no loops in saddle or bridle, rode across the ice through the wood to his kiln, and told the troll-woman and her children to get in."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Then he quickly turned back through the wood, out on the ice, and there let his horse run as fast as he could."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"When he reached the middle of the lake, he saw a pack of wolves running along in the direction of Aboda-land, at the northern end of the lake, and heading for the ice."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Then he tore the saddle-harness from the traces, so that the wagon with the troll-folk was left standing on the bare ice, and rode as fast as his horse could carry him for the opposite shore."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,When the trolls saw the wolves they began to scream.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""Turn back, turn back!"" cried the mother."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""And if you will not for my sake, then at least do so for the sake of Vipa (Peewee), your youngest daughter!"""
charcol-nils-troll-woman,But Charcoal Nils rode for the shore without looking back.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,Then he heard the troll-woman calling on others for aid.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""Brother in the Harsberg, Sister in Stripa, Cousin in Ringfels; Take the loop and pull!"""
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""There is no loop to pull!"" came the answer from deep within the Harsberg."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""Then catch him at Harkallarn."""
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"""He is not riding in that direction."""
charcol-nils-troll-woman,The reply came from Ringfels.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,And indeed Charcoal Nils did not ride in that direction; but over stick and stone straight to his own home.
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Yet when he reached his own courtyard, the horse fell, and a shot from the trolls tore away a corner of the stable."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"Nils shortly after fell sick, and had to lie a-bed for a number of weeks."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,"When he was well again he sold his forest land, and worked the little farm by the cottage until his death."
charcol-nils-troll-woman,So that was one occasion when the troll-folk came off second best.
magic-apples,Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
magic-apples,"He was never short of money, for he had a purse which was never empty."
magic-apples,"He never was short of food, for he had a table-cloth on which, as soon as he spread it, he found all he wanted to eat and drink."
magic-apples,"And, besides, he had a magic wishing cap."
magic-apples,"When he put it on he could wish himself wherever he wanted, and there he would be that very moment."
magic-apples,"There was only one thing that he lacked: he had no wife, and he was gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to make haste."
magic-apples,"As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it occurred to him to wish himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world."
magic-apples,No sooner had he thought of it than he was there.
magic-apples,"And it was a land which he had never yet seen, and a city in which he had never yet been."
magic-apples,"And the king had a daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld her like, and he wanted to have her on the spot."
magic-apples,"But she would have nothing to do with him, and was very haughty."
magic-apples,"Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside himself that he could no longer be where she was not."
magic-apples,So he took his magic cap and wished himself into the castle.
magic-apples,"He wanted to say good-by, so he said."
magic-apples,And she laid her hand in his.
magic-apples,"""I wish we were far beyond the end of the world!"" said the youth, and there they were."
magic-apples,"But the king's daughter wept, and begged to be allowed to go home again."
magic-apples,He could have all the gold and silver in the castle in return.
magic-apples,"""I have money enough for myself,"" said the youth, and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about."
magic-apples,"He could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food, and drink the finest wines, said she."
magic-apples,"""I have enough to eat and drink myself,"" said the youth."
magic-apples,"""See, you can sit down at the table,"" said he, and at once he spread his table-cloth."
magic-apples,And there stood a table covered with the best one might wish; and the king himself ate no better.
magic-apples,"After they had eaten, the king's daughter said: ""O, do look at the handsome apples up there on the tree! If you were really kind, you would fetch me down a couple of them!"""
magic-apples,"The youth was not lazy, and climbed up."
magic-apples,"But he had forgotten his table-cloth and his purse, and these she took."
magic-apples,And while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off.
magic-apples,"She at once put it on and wished herself back in her own room, and there she was that minute."
magic-apples,"""You might have known it,"" said the youth to himself, and hurried down the tree."
magic-apples,He began to cry and did not know what to do.
magic-apples,"And as he was sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had thrown down."
magic-apples,"No sooner had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head, and when he looked more closely, he had a pair of horns."
magic-apples,"""Well, now it can do me no more harm,"" said he, and calmly went on eating the apples."
magic-apples,"But suddenly the horns had disappeared, and he was as before."
magic-apples,"""Good enough!"" said the youth."
magic-apples,"And with that he put the apples in his pocket, and set out to search for the king's daughter."
magic-apples,"He went from city to city, and sailed from country to country; but it was a long journey, and lasted a year and a day, and even longer."
magic-apples,But one day he got there after all.
magic-apples,"It was a Sunday, and he found out that the king's daughter was at church."
magic-apples,"Then he sat himself down with his apples before the church door, and pretended to be a peddler."
magic-apples,"""Apples of Damascus! Apples of Damascus!"""
magic-apples,he cried.
magic-apples,"And sure enough, the king's daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see what desirable things the peddler from abroad might have to offer."
magic-apples,"Yes, he had apples of Damascus."
magic-apples,"""What do the apples give one?"" asked the maiden."
magic-apples,"""Wisdom and beauty!"" said the peddler, and the maiden bought."
magic-apples,"When the king's daughter had eaten of the apples, she had a pair of horns."
magic-apples,And then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was pitiful to hear.
magic-apples,"And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides."
magic-apples,"Then Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along."
magic-apples,But none of them could help the princess.
magic-apples,But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court.
magic-apples,"He was not from their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try his luck here."
magic-apples,"But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and permission was granted him."
magic-apples,"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn."
magic-apples,"""If I help you now, will you marry me?"" asked the youth."
magic-apples,"Yes, indeed she would."
magic-apples,"Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only half as large as before."
magic-apples,"""But I cannot do more until I have my cap, and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he."
magic-apples,So she went and brought him the things.
magic-apples,"Then he gave her still another magic apple, and now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets."
magic-apples,"""But now I cannot go on until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he."
magic-apples,And she swore that she would.
magic-apples,"And after she had eaten the third apple, her forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than in days gone by."
magic-apples,Then there was great joy in the castle.
magic-apples,"They prepared for the wedding with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come to it."
magic-apples,"And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very day!"
black-arts,The wild people who dwell in the South-West are masters of many black arts.
black-arts,"They often lure men of the Middle Kingdom to their country by promising them their daughters in marriage, but their promises are not to be trusted."
black-arts,"Once there was the son of a poor family, who agreed to labor for three years for one of the wild men in order to become his son-in-law."
black-arts,"At the end of that time the wedding was celebrated, and the couple were given a little house for a home."
black-arts,"But no sooner had they entered it than the wife warned her husband to be on his guard, since her parents did not like him, and would seek to do him harm."
black-arts,"In accordance with the custom she entered the house first with a lighted lantern, but when the bridegroom followed her she had disappeared."
black-arts,"And thus it went, day by day."
black-arts,"During the daytime she was there, but when evening came she disappeared."
black-arts,"And one day, not long after they had been married, his wife said to him: ""To-morrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday, and you must go to congratulate her. They will offer you tea and food. The tea you may drink, but be sure not to touch any of the food. Keep this in mind!"""
black-arts,So the following day the wife and husband went to her mother's home and offered their congratulations.
black-arts,"Her parents seemed highly pleased, and served them with tea and sweets."
black-arts,"The son-in-law drank, but ate nothing, though his wife's parents, with kind words and friendly gestures, kept urging him to help himself."
black-arts,"At last the son-in-law did not know what to do, and thought that surely they could mean him no ill."
black-arts,"And seeing the fresh caught eels and crabs on the plate before him, he ate a little of them."
black-arts,"His wife gave him a reproachful glance, and he offered some excuse for taking his leave."
black-arts,"But his mother-in-law said: ""This is my birthday. You simply must taste my birthday noodles!"""
black-arts,"With that she placed a great dish before him, filled with noodles that looked like threads of silver, mingled with fat meat, and spiced with fragrant mushrooms."
black-arts,During all the time he had been living in the country the son-in-law had never yet seen such an appetizing dish.
black-arts,"Its pleasant odor rose temptingly to his nostrils, and he could not resist raising his chop-sticks."
black-arts,"His wife glanced over at him, but he pretended that he did not see her."
black-arts,"She coughed significantly, but he acted as though he did not hear."
black-arts,Finally she trod on his foot under the table; and then he regained control of himself.
black-arts,"He had not as yet eaten half of the food and said: ""My hunger is satisfied."""
black-arts,"Then he took leave, and went off with his wife."
black-arts,"""This is a serious matter,"" said the latter."
black-arts,"""You would not listen to my words, and now you will surely have to die!"""
black-arts,"But still he did not believe her, until he suddenly felt terrible pains, which soon grew unbearable, so that he fell to the ground unconscious."
black-arts,"His wife at once hung him up by the feet from the beam of the roof, and put a panful of glowing charcoal under his body, and a great jar of water, into which she had poured sesame oil, in front of the fire, directly below his mouth."
black-arts,"And when the fire had heated him thoroughly, he suddenly opened his mouth-and can you imagine what came out of it?"
black-arts,"A squirming, crawling mass of poisonous worms, centipedes, toads and tadpoles, who all fell into the jar of water."
black-arts,"Then his wife untied him, carried him to bed, and gave him wine mingled with realgar to drink."
black-arts,Then he recovered.
black-arts,"""What you ate in the belief that they were eels and crabs,"" said his wife, ""were nothing but toads and tadpoles, and the birthday noodles were poisonous worms and centipedes. But you must continue to be careful. My parents know that you have not died, and they will think up other evil plans."""
black-arts,"A few days later his father-in-law said to him: ""There is a large tree growing on the precipice which juts over the cave. In it is the nest of the phenix. You are still young and able to climb, so go there quickly and fetch me the eggs!"""
black-arts,His son-in-law went home and told his wife.
black-arts,"""Take long bamboo poles,"" said she, ""and tie them together, and fasten a curved sword at the top. And take these nine loaves of bread and these hens' eggs, there are seven times seven of them. Carry them along with you in a basket. When you come to the spot you will see a large nest up in the branches. Do not climb the tree, but chop it down with the curved sword. Then throw away your poles, and run for dear life. Should a monster appear and follow you, throw him the loaves of bread, three loaves at a time, and finally throw down the eggs on the ground and make for home as quickly as you can. In this way you may escape the danger which threatens you."""
black-arts,The man noted all she said exactly and went.
black-arts,And sure enough he saw the bird's nest-it was as large as a round pavilion.
black-arts,"Then he tied his curved sword to the poles, chopped at the tree with all his strength, laid down his poles on the ground and never looked around but ran for dear life."
black-arts,Suddenly he heard the roaring of a thunder-storm rising above him.
black-arts,"When he looked up he saw a great dragon, many fathoms long and some ten feet across."
black-arts,His eyes gleamed like two lamps and he was spitting fire and flame from his maw.
black-arts,He had stretched out two feelers and was feeling along the ground.
black-arts,Then the man swiftly flung the loaves into the air.
black-arts,"The dragon caught them, and it took a little time before he had devoured them."
black-arts,But no sooner had the man gained a few steps than the dragon once more came flying after him.
black-arts,"Then he flung him more loaves and when the loaves came to an end, he turned over his basket so that the eggs rolled over the ground."
black-arts,The dragon had not yet satisfied his hunger and opened his greedy jaws wide.
black-arts,"When he suddenly caught sight of the eggs, he descended from the air, and since the eggs were scattered round about, it took some time before he had sucked them all."
black-arts,In the meantime the man succeeded in escaping to his home.
black-arts,"When he entered the door and saw his wife, he said to her, amid sobs: ""It was all I could do to escape, and I am lucky not to be in the dragon's stomach! If this sort of thing keeps up much longer I am bound to die!"""
black-arts,With these words he kneeled and begged his wife pitifully to save his life.
black-arts,"""Where is your home?"" asked his wife."
black-arts,"""My home is about a hundred miles away from here, in the Middle Kingdom, and my old mother is still living. The only thing that worries me is that we are so poor."""
black-arts,"His wife said: ""I will flee with you, and we will find your mother. And waste no regrets on your poverty."""
black-arts,"With that she gathered up all the house held in the way of pearls and precious stones, put them in a bag and had her husband tie it around his waist."
black-arts,"Then she also gave him an umbrella, and in the middle of the night they climbed the wall with the aid of a ladder, and stole away."
black-arts,"His wife had also said to him: ""Take the umbrella on your back and run as fast as ever you can! Do not open it, and do not look around! I will follow you in secret."""
black-arts,So he turned North and ran with all his might and main.
black-arts,"He had been running for a day and a night, had covered nearly a hundred miles, and passed the boundaries of the wild people's country, when his legs gave out and he grew hungry."
black-arts,Before him lay a mountain village.
black-arts,"He stopped at the village gate to rest, drew some food from his pocket and began to eat."
black-arts,And he looked around without being able to see his wife.
black-arts,"Said he to himself: ""Perhaps she has deceived me after all, and is not coming with me!"""
black-arts,"After he had finished eating, he took a drink from a spring, and painfully dragged himself further."
black-arts,When the heat of the day was greatest a violent mountain rain suddenly began to fall.
black-arts,In his haste he forgot what his wife had told him and opened his umbrella.
black-arts,And out fell his wife upon the ground.
black-arts,"She reproached him: ""Once more you have not listened to my advice. Now the damage has been done!"""
black-arts,"Quickly she told him to go to the village, and there to buy a white cock, seven black tea-cups, and half a length of red nettlecloth."
black-arts,"""Do not be sparing of the silver pieces in your pocket!"""
black-arts,she cried after him as he went off.
black-arts,"He went to the village, attended to everything, and came back."
black-arts,"The woman tore the cloth apart, made a coat of it and put it on."
black-arts,"No sooner had they walked a few miles before they could see a red cloud rising up in the South, like a flying bird."
black-arts,"""That is my mother,"" said the woman."
black-arts,In a moment the cloud was overhead.
black-arts,Then the woman took the black tea-cups and threw them at it.
black-arts,Seven she threw and seven fell to earth again.
black-arts,"And then they could hear the mother in the cloud weeping and scolding, and thereupon the cloud disappeared."
black-arts,They went on for about four hours.
black-arts,"Then they heard a sound like the noise of silk being torn, and could see a cloud as black as ink, which was rushing up against the wind."
black-arts,"""Alas, that is my father!"" said the woman."
black-arts,"""This is a matter of life and death, for he will not let us be! Because of my love for you I will now have to disobey the holiest of laws!"""
black-arts,"With these words she quickly seized the white cock, separated its head from its body, and flung the head into the air."
black-arts,"At once the black cloud dissolved, and her father's body, the head severed from the trunk, fell down by the edge of the road."
black-arts,"Then the woman wept bitterly, and when she had wept her fill they buried the corpse."
black-arts,"Thereupon they went together to her husband's home, where they found his old mother still living."
black-arts,"They then undid the bag of pearls and jewels, bought a piece of good ground, built a fine house, and became wealthy and respected members of the community."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Long, long ago, there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He was very poor and sad also, for no child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age, and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When he had made his choice, he would cut down these feathers of the forest, and splitting them lengthwise, or cutting them into joints, would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles for the household, and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"One morning as usual he had gone out to his work, and having found a nice clump of bamboos, had set to work to cut some of them down."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with a bright soft light, as if the full moon had risen over the spot."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Looking round in astonishment, he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old man, full of wonder, dropped his ax and went towards the light."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"On nearer approach he saw that this soft splendor came from a hollow in the green bamboo stem, and still more wonderful to behold, in the midst of the brilliance stood a tiny human being, only three inches in height, and exquisitely beautiful in appearance."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""You must be sent to be my child, for I find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily work,"" said the old man, and taking the little creature in his hand he took it home to his wife to bring up."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The tiny girl was so exceedingly beautiful and so small, that the old woman put her into a basket to safeguard her from the least possibility of being hurt in any way."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old couple were now very happy, for it had been a lifelong regret that they had no children of their own, and with joy they now expended all the love of their old age on the little child who had come to them in so marvelous a manner."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"From this time on, the old man often found gold in the notches of the bamboos when he hewed them down and cut them up; not only gold, but precious stones also, so that by degrees he became rich."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He built himself a fine house, and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter, but as a wealthy man."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Three months passed quickly away, and in that time the bamboo child had, wonderful to say, become a full-grown girl, so her foster-parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful kimonos."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She was of such wondrous beauty that they placed her behind the screens like a princess, and allowed no one to see her, waiting upon her themselves."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"It seemed as if she were made of light, for the house was filled with a soft shining, so that even in the dark of night it was like daytime."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Whenever the old man felt sad, he had only to look upon his foster-daughter and his sorrow vanished, and he became as happy as when he was a youth."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"At last the day came for the naming of their new-found child, so the old couple called in a celebrated name-giver, and he gave her the name of Princess Moonlight, because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the Moon God."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,For three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"All the friends and relations of the old couple were present, and great was their enjoyment of the festivities held to celebrate the naming of Princess Moonlight."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Everyone who saw her declared that there never had been seen any one so lovely; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of the land would grow pale beside her, so they said."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The fame of the Princess's loveliness spread far and wide, and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand, or even so much as to see her."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Suitors from far and near posted themselves outside the house, and made little holes in the fence, in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Princess as she went from one room to the other along the veranda."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"They stayed there day and night, sacrificing even their sleep for a chance of seeing her, but all in vain."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then they approached the house, and tried to speak to the old man and his wife or some of the servants, but not even this was granted them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Still, in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day, and night after night, and counted it as nothing, so great was their desire to see the Princess."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"At last, however, most of the men, seeing how hopeless their quest was, lost heart and hope both, and returned to their homes."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"All except five Knights, whose ardor and determination, instead of waning, seemed to wax greater with obstacles."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"These five men even went without their meals, and took snatches of whatever they could get brought to them, so that they might always stand outside the dwelling."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"They stood there in all weathers, in sunshine and in rain."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Sometimes they wrote letters to the Princess, but no answer was vouchsafed to them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then when letters failed to draw any reply, they wrote poems to her telling her of the hopeless love which kept them from sleep, from food, from rest, and even from their homes."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Still Princes Moonlight gave no sign of having received their verses.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,In this hopeless state the winter passed.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then the summer came, and the sun burned white and scorching in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, and still these faithful Knights kept watch and waited."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"At the end of these long months they called out to the old bamboo-cutter and entreated him to have some mercy upon them and to show them the Princess, but he answered only that as he was not her real father he could not insist on her obeying him against her wishes."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The five Knights on receiving this stern answer returned to their several homes, and pondered over the best means of touching the proud Princess's heart, even so much as to grant them a hearing."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"They took their rosaries in hand and knelt before their household shrines, and burned precious incense, praying to Buddha to give them their heart's desire."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Thus several days passed, but even so they could not rest in their homes."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,So again they set out for the bamboo-cutter's house.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"This time the old man came out to see them, and they asked him to let them know if it was the Princess's resolution never to see any man whatsoever, and they implored him to speak for them and to tell her the greatness of their love, and how long they had waited through the cold of winter and the heat of summer, sleepless and roofless through all weathers, without food and without rest, in the ardent hope of winning her, and they were willing to consider this long vigil as pleasure if she would but give them one chance of pleading their cause with her."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old man lent a willing ear to their tale of love, for in his inmost heart he felt sorry for these faithful suitors and would have liked to see his lovely foster-daughter married to one of them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So he went in to Princess Moonlight and said reverently: ""Although you have always seemed to me to be a heavenly being, yet I have had the trouble of bringing you up as my own child and you have been glad of the protection of my roof. Will you refuse to do as I wish?"""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then Princess Moonlight replied that there was nothing she would not do for him, that she honored and loved him as her own father, and that as for herself she could not remember the time before she came to earth."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The old man listened with great joy as she spoke these dutiful words.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Then he told her how anxious he was to see her safely and happily married before he died.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""I am an old man, over seventy years of age, and my end may come any time now. It is necessary and right that you should see these five suitors and choose one of them."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""Oh, why,"" said the Princess in distress, ""must I do this? I have no wish to marry now."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""I found you,"" answered the old man, ""many years ago, when you were a little creature three inches high, in the midst of a great white light. The light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you. So I have always thought that you were more than mortal woman. While I am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so, but some day I shall cease to be and who will take care of you then? Therefore I pray you to meet these five brave men one at a time and make up your mind to marry one of them!"""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then the Princess answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report made her out to be, and that even if she consented to marry any one of them, not really knowing her before, his heart might change afterwards."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So as she did not feel sure of them, even though her father told her they were worthy Knights, she did not feel it wise to see them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""All you say is very reasonable,"" said the old man, ""but what kind of men will you consent to see? I do not call these five men who have waited on you for months, light-hearted. They have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer, often denying themselves food and sleep so that they may win you. What more can you demand?"""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Then Princess Moonlight said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant their request to interview her.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing her from distant countries something that she desired to possess.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"That same evening the suitors arrived and began to play their flutes in turn, and to sing their self-composed songs telling of their great and tireless love."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The bamboo-cutter went out to them and offered them his sympathy for all they had endured and all the patience they had shown in their desire to win his foster-daughter.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then he gave them her message, that she would consent to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,This was to test them.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The five all accepted the trial, and thought it an excellent plan, for it would prevent jealousy between them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Princess Moonlight then sent word to the First Knight that she requested him to bring her the stone bowl which had belonged to Buddha in India.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Second Knight was asked to go to the Mountain of Horai, said to be situated in the Eastern Sea, and to bring her a branch of the wonderful tree that grew on its summit."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The roots of this tree were of silver, the trunk of gold, and the branches bore as fruit white jewels."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The Third Knight was told to go to China and search for the fire-rat and to bring her its skin.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The Fourth Knight was told to search for the dragon that carried on its head the stone radiating five colors and to bring the stone to her.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The Fifth Knight was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring the shell to her.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old man thought these very hard tasks and hesitated to carry the messages, but the Princess would make no other conditions."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So her commands were issued word for word to the five men who, when they heard what was required of them, were all disheartened and disgusted at what seemed to them the impossibility of the tasks given them and returned to their own homes in despair."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"But after a time, when they thought of the Princess, the love in their hearts revived for her, and they resolved to make an attempt to get what she desired of them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The First Knight sent word to the Princess that he was starting out that day on the quest of Buddha's bowl, and he hoped soon to bring it to her."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"But he had not the courage to go all the way to India, for in those days traveling was very difficult and full of danger, so he went to one of the temples in Kyoto and took a stone bowl from the altar there, paying the priest a large sum of money for it."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and, waiting quietly for three years, returned and carried it to the old man."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Princess Moonlight wondered that the Knight should have returned so soon.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She took the bowl from its gold wrapping, expecting it to make the room full of light, but it did not shine at all, so she knew that it was a sham thing and not the true bowl of Buddha."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,She returned it at once and refused to see him.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The Knight threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,He gave up now all hopes of ever winning the Princess.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Second Knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health, for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the Princess Moonlight was the real cause of his leaving them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He then left his home, at the same time sending word to the Princess that he was setting out for Mount Horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she so much wished to have."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He only allowed his servants to accompany him half-way, and then sent them back."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship, and after sailing away for three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such a way that no one could get access to it."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers, and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the Princess as having come from the wonderful tree growing on Mount Horai."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Every one whom he had asked declared that Mount Horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When the branch was finished, he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo-cutter, begging him to present it to the Princess."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old man was quite deceived by the travel-stained appearance of the Knight, and thought that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,So he tried to persuade the Princess to consent to see the man.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,But she remained silent and looked very sad.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then he spoke of the Knight, how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken a journey to so remote a place as the Mount of Horai."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Princess Moonlight took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She then told her foster-parent that she knew it was impossible for the man to have obtained a branch from the gold and silver tree growing on Mount Horai so quickly or so easily, and she was sorry to say she believed it artificial."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old man then went out to the expectant Knight, who had now approached the house, and asked where he had found the branch."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Then the man did not scruple to make up a long story.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""Two years ago I took a ship and started in search of Mount Horai. After going before the wind for some time I reached the far Eastern Sea. Then a great storm arose and I was tossed about for many days, losing all count of the points of the compass, and finally we were blown ashore on an unknown island. Here I found the place inhabited by demons who at one time threatened to kill and eat me. However, I managed to make friends with these horrible creatures, and they helped me and my sailors to repair the boat, and I set sail again. Our food gave out, and we suffered much from sickness on board. At last, on the five-hundredth day from the day of starting, I saw far off on the horizon what looked like the peak of a mountain. On nearer approach, this proved to be an island, in the center of which rose a high mountain. I landed, and after wandering about for two or three days, I saw a shining being coming towards me on the beach, holding in his hands a golden bowl. I went up to him and asked him if I had, by good chance, found the island of Mount Horai, and he answered:"" ""Yes, this is Mount Horai!"""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""With much difficulty I climbed to the summit, here stood the golden tree growing with silver roots in the ground. The wonders of that strange land are many, and if I began to tell you about them I could never stop. In spite of my wish to stay there long, on breaking off the branch I hurried back. With utmost speed it has taken me four hundred days to get back, and, as you see, my clothes are still damp from exposure on the long sea voyage. I have not even waited to change my raiment, so anxious was I to bring the branch to the Princess quickly."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Just at this moment the six jewelers, who had been employed on the making of the branch, but not yet paid by the Knight, arrived at the house and sent in a petition to the Princess to be paid for their labor."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"They said that they had worked for over a thousand days making the branch of gold, with its silver twigs and its jeweled fruit, that was now presented to her by the Knight, but as yet they had received nothing in payment."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So this Knight's deception was thus found out, and the Princess, glad of an escape from one more importunate suitor, was only too pleased to send back the branch."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She called in the workmen and had them paid liberally, and they went away happy."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"But on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man, who beat them till they were nearly dead, for letting out the secret, and they barely escaped with their lives."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Knight then returned home, raging in his heart; and in despair of ever winning the Princess gave up society and retired to a solitary life among the mountains."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Now the Third Knight had a friend in China, so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire-rat."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,He promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"As soon as the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port, he rode seven days on horseback to meet him."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He handed his friend a large sum of money, and received the fire-rat's skin."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,When he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the Princess while he waited outside for her answer.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The bamboo-cutter took the box from the Knight and, as usual, carried it in to her and tried to coax her to see the Knight at once, but Princess Moonlight refused, saying that she must first put the skin to test by putting it into the fire."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,If it were the real thing it would not burn.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So she took off the crape wrapper and opened the box, and then threw the skin into the fire."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The skin crackled and burnt up at once, and the Princess knew that this man also had not fulfilled his word."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,So the Third Knight failed also.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Now the Fourth Knight was no more enterprising than the rest.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Instead of starting out on the quest of the dragon bearing on its head the five-color-radiating jewel, he called all his servants together and gave them the order to seek for it far and wide in Japan and in China, and he strictly forbade any of them to return till they had found it."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"His numerous retainers and servants started out in different directions, with no intention, however, of obeying what they considered an impossible order."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"They simply took a holiday, went to pleasant country places together, and grumbled at their master's unreasonableness."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Knight meanwhile, thinking that his retainers could not fail to find the jewel, repaired to his house, and fitted it up beautifully for the reception of the Princess, he felt so sure of winning her."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"One year passed away in weary waiting, and still his men did not return with the dragon-jewel."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The Knight became desperate.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He could wait no longer, so taking with him only two men he hired a ship and commanded the captain to go in search of the dragon; the captain and the sailors refused to undertake what they said was an absurd search, but the Knight compelled them at last to put out to sea."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When they had been but a few days out they encountered a great storm which lasted so long that, by the time its fury abated, the Knight had determined to give up the hunt of the dragon."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"They were at last blown on shore, for navigation was primitive in those days."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Worn out with his travels and anxiety, the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He had caught a very heavy cold, and had to go to bed with a swollen face."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The governor of the place, hearing of his plight, sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"While he was there thinking over all his troubles, his love for the Princess turned to anger, and he blamed her for all the hardships he had undergone."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He thought that it was quite probable she had wished to kill him so that she might be rid of him, and in order to carry out her wish had sent him upon his impossible quest."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"At this point all the servants he had sent out to find the jewel came to see him, and were surprised to find praise instead of displeasure awaiting them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Their master told them that he was heartily sick of adventure, and said that he never intended to go near the Princess's house again in the future."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Like all the rest, the Fifth Knight failed in his quest-he could not find the swallow's shell."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"By this time the fame of Princess Moonlight's beauty had reached the ears of the Emperor, and he sent one of the Court ladies to see if she were really as lovely as report said; if so he would summon her to the Palace and make her one of the ladies-in-waiting."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When the Court lady arrived, in spite of her father's entreaties, Princess Moonlight refused to see her."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Imperial messenger insisted, saying it was the Emperor's order."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then Princess Moonlight told the old man that if she was forced to go to the Palace in obedience to the Emperor's order, she would vanish from the earth."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When the Emperor was told of her persistence in refusing to obey his summons, and that if pressed to obey she would disappear altogether from sight, he determined to go and see her."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So he planned to go on a hunting excursion in the neighborhood of the bamboo-cutter's house, and see the Princess himself."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He sent word to the old man of his intention, and he received consent to the scheme."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The next day the Emperor set out with his retinue, which he soon managed to outride."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,He found the bamboo-cutter's house and dismounted.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,He then entered the house and went straight to where the Princess was sitting with her attendant maidens.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Never had he seen any one so wonderfully beautiful, and he could not but look at her, for she was more lovely than any human being as she shone in her own soft radiance."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When Princess Moonlight became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room, but the Emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Emperor fell deeply in love with her, and begged her to come to the Court, where he would give her a position of honor and everything she could wish for."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"He was about to send for one of the Imperial palanquins to take her back with him at once, saying that her grace and beauty should adorn a Court, and not be hidden in a bamboo-cutter's cottage."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,But the Princess stopped him.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She said that if she were forced to go to the Palace she would turn at once into a shadow, and even as she spoke she began to lose her form."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Her figure faded from his sight while he looked.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Emperor then promised to leave her free if only she would resume her former shape, which she did."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"It was now time for him to return, for his retinue would be wondering what had happened to their Royal master when they missed him for so long."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"So he bade her good-by, and left the house with a sad heart."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Princess Moonlight was for him the most beautiful woman in the world; all others were dark beside her, and he thought of her night and day."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"His Majesty now spent much of his time in writing poems, telling her of his love and devotion, and sent them to her, and though she refused to see him again she answered with many verses of her own composing, which told him gently and kindly that she could never marry any one on this earth."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,These little songs always gave him pleasure.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"At this time her foster-parents noticed that night after night the Princess would sit on her balcony and gaze for hours at the moon, in a spirit of the deepest dejection, ending always in a burst of tears."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"One night the old man found her thus weeping as if her heart were broken, and he besought her to tell him the reason of her sorrow."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"With many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong to this world-that she had in truth come from the moon, and that her time on earth would soon be over."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"On the fifteenth day of that very month of August her friends from the moon would come to fetch her, and she would have to return."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Her parents were both there, but having spent a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them, and also the moon-world to which she belonged."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"It made her weep, she said, to think of leaving her kind foster-parents, and the home where she had been happy for so long."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"When her attendants heard this they were very sad, and could not eat or drink for sadness at the thought that the Princess was so soon to leave them."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The Emperor, as soon as the news was carried to him, sent messengers to the house to find out if the report were true or not."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The old bamboo-cutter went out to meet the Imperial messengers.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The last few days of sorrow had told upon the old man; he had aged greatly, and looked much more than his seventy years."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Weeping bitterly, he told them that the report was only too true, but he intended, however, to make prisoners of the envoys from the moon, and to do all he could to prevent the Princess from being carried back."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The men returned and told His Majesty all that had passed.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,On the fifteenth day of that month the Emperor sent a guard of two thousand warriors to watch the house.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"One thousand stationed themselves on the roof, another thousand kept watch round all the entrances of the house."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"All were well trained archers, with bows and arrows."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The bamboo-cutter and his wife hid Princess Moonlight in an inner room.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The old man gave orders that no one was to sleep that night, all in the house were to keep a strict watch, and be ready to protect the Princess."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"With these precautions, and the help of the Emperor's men-at-arms, he hoped to withstand the moon-messengers, but the Princess told him that all these measures to keep her would be useless, and that when her people came for her nothing whatever could prevent them from carrying out their purpose."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Even the Emperors men would be powerless.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then she added with tears that she was very, very sorry to leave him and his wife, whom she had learned to love as her parents, that if she could do as she liked she would stay with them in their old age, and try to make some return for all the love and kindness they had showered upon her during all her earthly life."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The night wore on!
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The yellow harvest moon rose high in the heavens, flooding the world asleep with her golden light."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Silence reigned over the pine and the bamboo forests, and on the roof where the thousand men-at-arms waited."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Then the night grew gray towards the dawn and all hoped that the danger was over-that Princess Moonlight would not have to leave them after all.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Then suddenly the watchers saw a cloud form round the moon-and while they looked this cloud began to roll earthwards.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Nearer and nearer it came, and every one saw with dismay that its course lay towards the house."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"In a short time the sky was entirely obscured, till at last the cloud lay over the dwelling only ten feet off the ground."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"In the midst of the cloud there stood a flying chariot, and in the chariot a band of luminous beings."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"One amongst them who looked like a king and appeared to be the chief stepped out of the chariot, and, poised in air, called to the old man to come out."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""The time has come,"" he said, ""for Princess Moonlight to return to the moon from whence she came. She committed a grave fault, and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time. We know what good care you have taken of the Princess, and we have rewarded you for this and have sent you wealth and prosperity. We put the gold in the bamboos for you to find."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""I have brought up this Princess for twenty years and never once has she done a wrong thing, therefore the lady you are seeking cannot be this one,"" said the old man."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"""I pray you to look elsewhere."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then the messenger called aloud, saying: ""Princess Moonlight, come out from this lowly dwelling. Rest not here another moment."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"At these words the screens of the Princess's room slid open of their own accord, revealing the Princess shining in her own radiance, bright and wonderful and full of beauty."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She looked back, and saw with pity the deep sorrow of the old man."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She spoke to him many comforting words, and told him that it was not her will to leave him and that he must always think of her when looking at the moon."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The bamboo-cutter implored to be allowed to accompany her, but this was not allowed."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,The Princess took off her embroidered outer garment and gave it to him as a keepsake.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"One of the moon beings in the chariot held a wonderful coat of wings, another had a phial full of the Elixir of Life which was given the Princess to drink."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She swallowed a little and was about to give the rest to the old man, but she was prevented from doing so."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"The robe of wings was about to be put upon her shoulders, but she said: ""Wait a little. I must not forget my good friend the Emperor. I must write him once more to say good-by while still in this human form."""
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,In spite of the impatience of the messengers and charioteers she kept them waiting while she wrote.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"She placed the phial of the Elixir of Life with the letter, and, giving them to the old man, she asked him to deliver them to the Emperor."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Then the chariot began to roll heavenwards towards the moon, and as they all gazed with tearful eyes at the receding Princess, the dawn broke, and in the rosy light of day the moon-chariot and all in it were lost amongst the fleecy clouds that were now wafted across the sky on the wings of the morning wind."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,Princess Moonlight's letter was carried to the Palace.
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"His Majesty was afraid to touch the Elixir of Life, so he sent it with the letter to the top of the most sacred mountain in the land."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,"Mount Fuji, and there the Royal emissaries burnt it on the summit at sunrise."
bamboo-cutter-moon-child,So to this day people say there is smoke to be seen rising from the top of Mount Fuji to the clouds.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"ONCE upon a time there was a sinister old couple, who lived out under the open sky."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"All that they had were three sons, an old cook-pot, an old frying-pan, and an old cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then the man died, and after a time his wife died, too."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,Now their estate was to be divided.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"So the oldest took the old cook-pot, and the second took the old frying-pan, and Ebe Ashpeter had no choice."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"He had to take the old cat, and they did not ask him whether he wanted to or not."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Brother Peter can scrape out the cook-pot after he has loaned it out,"" said Ebe."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Brother Paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; but what am I to do with this wretched cat?"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,And he was angry and envious.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Yet he scratched the cat and stroked it, and this pleased the cat so that she began to purr, and raised her tail in the air."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Wait, wait, I'll help you yet,"" said the cat, ""wait, wait, I'll help you yet!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,There was nothing to bite or break in the hut.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,Brother Peter and Brother Paul had each of them gone off in a different direction.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"So Ebe set out, too, with the cat in the lead, himself following; but after a time he turned and went home again, to see whether the floor had been swept, and the cat tripped on alone."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a great rock, and there she met an enormous herd of reindeer."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The cat crept softly around the herd, and then with one leap sprang between the horns of the finest buck."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""If you do not go where I want you to, I'll scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,said she.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"So the buck did not dare do anything save what the cat wished, and off they went over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, close by Ebe, who was just polishing the door-sill of his house, and with one bound right into the castle."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and ask whether my lord king might care to have this buck reindeer to drive,"" said the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Yes, he could make good use of such a young, handsome animal, some time, when he had occasion to drive out to visit a neighboring king."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""This Ebe must be a proud and powerful lord,"" said the king, ""if he can make me such presents."""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Yes, he is the greatest lord in all your land and kingdom,"" said the cat, but no matter how many questions the king asked, he learned nothing more."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Tell him that I am much obliged,"" said the king, and he sent him a whole cart-load of handsome presents."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,But Ebe looked past them and paid no attention to them.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Brother Peter can scrape out his cook-pot when he has loaned it out, and Brother Paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; but what am I to do with this wretched cat!"" said he, and felt angry and envious; but still he scratched the cat, and stroked her, and this pleased her so much that she began to purr, and raised her tail in the air."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Wait, wait, I will help you yet,"" said the cat, ""wait, wait, I will help you yet!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The next day they both set out again, the cat in the lead, and Ebe following."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,After a while he turned back to see whether the folding-table at home had been scoured.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,And the cat tripped on alone.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a dense forest slope."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,There she found an enormous herd of elk.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The cat crept softly up, and suddenly there she sat between the horns of one of the stateliest of the bull elks."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""If you do not go where I want you to, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,said the cat.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The elk did not dare do anything save what the cat wished, and so off they went, like lightning, over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, right past Ebe, who stood before the house scouring the shutters, and with one bound into the king's castle."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bull elk for courier service."""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"It was quite clear that should the king want a swift messenger, some time, he could not find a swifter in all his kingdom."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""This Ebe must be a most distinguished lord, since he finds such presents for me,"" said the king."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Yes, indeed, one might call him a distinguished lord,"" said the cat, ""his wealth is without end or limit."""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"But no matter how many other questions the king asked, he received no more explicit information."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Tell him that I am much obliged, and to do me the honor to call when he is passing here some time,"" said the king, and sent him a robe as handsome as the one he himself was wearing, and three cartloads of handsome presents."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"But Ebe did not even want to put on the royal robe, and hardly looked at the other presents."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Brother Peter can scrape out his cook-pot when he has loaned it out, Brother Paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; but of what use is this wretched cat to me!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"he said, in spite of all."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Yet he stroked the cat, and pressed her to his cheek, and scratched her, and this pleased the cat so very much that she purred more than on the other occasions, and stuck her tail up into the air as straight as a rod."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Wait, wait, I will help you yet,"" said the cat, ""wait, wait, I will help you yet!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"On the third day they set out again, the cat in the lead, and Ebe following."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"After a time it occurred to him to go back and let the mice out of the house, so that they would not be altogether starved in the old hut; and the cat tripped on alone."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a dense pine forest, and there she met a father bear, a mother bear and a baby bear."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The cat crept softly up to them, and all at once she was hanging by her claws to the father bear's head."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""If you do not go where I want you to, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"said the cat, and spit and arched her back."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then the father bear did not dare do anything save what the cat wished, and now they dashed past Ebe, who had just carried all the young mice over the threshold, like a storm, over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, so that the earth trembled and shook."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The king was just standing in the hallway, and was not a little surprised to see such guests arriving."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bear for a general or royal counselor,"" said the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The king was more than pleased to secure such a creature for his nearest adviser, who could doubt it."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Tell him that I am much obliged, but that I do not at all know how to show my appreciation,"" said the king."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Well, he would like to marry your youngest daughter!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,said the cat.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Yes, but that is asking a good deal,"" said the king."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""He really ought to pay me a visit."""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Ebe does not enter such plain houses,"" said the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Has he a handsomer castle than this?"" asked the king."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Handsomer? Why, your castle seems like the shabbiest hut in comparison with his!"" was the cat's reply."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""You dare come into my presence, and tell me that there is some one living in my kingdom who is more handsomely housed than I, the king!"" shouted the king, beside himself with rage."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,He came near wringing the cat's neck.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""You might wait until you see it,"" said the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"And the king said yes, he would wait."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""But if you have told me a falsehood, you shall die, and though you had seven lives,"" said he."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,In the morning the king and the whole court set out to travel to Ebe Ashpeter's castle.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The cat was in the little hut, and called for Ebe, thinking it would be best if both of them got underway an hour earlier."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"After they had gone a while, they met some folk who were herding sheep; and the sheep were bleating and grazing over the whole plain."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"They were as large as full-grown calves, and their wool was so long that it dragged along the ground after them."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""To whom do the sheep belong?"" asked the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""To Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,"" said the shepherds."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""The court is coming past in a moment,"" said the cat, ""and if then you do not at once say that they belong to Ebe, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" said the cat, and spat and arched her back, and showed her teeth."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,Then the shepherds were so frightened that they at once promised to do as the cat had ordered.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""But to whom do all these sheep belong?"" asked the king, when he came by with the court somewhat later."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""They are every bit as handsome as my own!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""They belong to Ebe,"" said the shepherds."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then the cat and Ebe wandered on for a while, and came to a dense forest slope."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,There they met folk who were tending goats.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The goats skipped and leaped about everywhere, and gave such fine milk that better could no where be found."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""To whom do the goats belong?"" asked the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""To Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,"" said the herdsmen."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then the cat again went through her ferocious preparations, and the herdsmen were so frightened that they did not dare oppose her wishes."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Now who in the world can be the owner of so many goats?"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,asked the king.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""I myself have none finer!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""They belong to Ebe,"" said the herdsmen."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then they wandered on for a while, and met folk who were tending cows: wherever one looked the cows lowed and glistened, and each yielded milk enough for three."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"When the cat heard that these herdsmen were also in the service of Helge-Hal of the Blue Hill, she spat once more, and arched her back, and then all the herdsmen were ready that moment to say what she wished."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""But in heaven's name, to whom do all these beautiful cattle belong?"" asked the king."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""There are no such cattle in my whole kingdom!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""They belong to Lord Ebe,"" said the herdsmen."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then they wandered on for a long, long time."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"At last they came to a great plain, and there they met horse-herders; and horses whinnied and disported themselves over the whole plain, and their coats were so fine that they glistened as though gilded, and each horse was worth a whole castle."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""For whom do you herd these horses?"" asked the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""For Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,"" the herders replied."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Well, the court will come by here in a little while,"" said the cat, ""and if you do not say you are herding them for Ebe, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" said the cat, and she spat, and showed her teeth and claws, and grew so angry her hair stood up all along her back."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then the herders were terribly frightened, and did not dare do anything but what the cat wished."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""But in the name of heaven, to whom do all these horses belong?"" asked the king, when he came by with his court."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""They belong to Ebe,"" said the herders."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""I never have seen or heard anything like it in all my life!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,cried the king.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""This Ebe is such a distinguished lord that it is past my understanding!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"The cat and Ebe had long since gone on their way, and had wandered far and ever farther over hill and rock."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"In the evening, at dusk, they came to a royal castle that glittered and shimmered as though it were of the purest silver and gold-which it was."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Yet it was gloomy and depressing, and lonely and barren there, and nowhere was there a sign of life."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Here they went in, and the cat stood with a cake of rye meal just below the door."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Suddenly there came a thundering and a thumping so that the earth trembled, and the whole castle shook, and that was the troll who was coming home."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"And suddenly all was quiet again, and before they knew it, Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill had thrust his three great horrible heads in at the door."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Let me in! Let me in!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"he cried, so that every one shivered."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Wait, wait a bit while I tell you what the rye had to go through before he was made into this cake,"" said the cat, and spoke to him in the sweetest way."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""First he was threshed, and then he was beaten, and then he was pounded, and then he was thumped, and then he was thrown from one wall to another, and then he was sifted through a sieve...."""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Let me in! Let me in, you chatterbox!"" cried the troll, and he was so furious that the sparks flew from him."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Wait a bit, wait a bit. I will tell you what the rye had to go through before he was made into this cake!"" said the cat, and he spoke to him still more sweetly."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""First he was threshed, and then he was beaten, and then he was pounded, and then he was thumped, and then he was thrown from one wall to another, and then he was sifted through a sieve, and shaken here and there, and then he was put on the drying-board, and then in the stove, until it grew so hot that he puffed up more and more, and wanted to get out, but could not,"" said the cat, and took her time."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Get out of the way and let me in!"" cried the troll once more, and nearly burst with rage; but the cat acted as though she did not hear him, and talked down the blue from the sky, and went up and down the while, and whenever the troll tried to come in, she met him beneath the door with the cake."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""O, but do take a look at the shining maiden coming up there behind the mountain!"" said the cat, after she had talked at length about the sufferings of the rye."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"And Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill turned his three heads around in order to see the beautiful maiden, too."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then the sun rose, and the troll stiffened into stone."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Now Ebe obtained all the riches that the troll had possessed, the sheep and goats, the cows and all the spirited horses, and the handsome golden castle, and some big bags of money besides."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Here come the king and all his court,"" said the cat."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Just go out before the door and receive them!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,So Ebe got up and went to meet them.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""You are indeed a very distinguished lord!"" said the king to him."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""So far as I am concerned you may have the youngest princess!"""
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"Then they started brewing and baking on a large scale in the greatest haste, and everything was made ready for the wedding."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,On the first day of the feast the cat came and begged the bridegroom to cut off her head.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"This he did not at all want to do; but the cat spat and showed her teeth, and then Ebe did not dare disobey her."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"But when the head fell to the ground, the cat turned into a most handsome prince."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"He married the second princess, and as the wedding procession was on its way to church, they met a third prince who was looking for a wife, and he took the oldest princess."
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,Then they all three celebrated their weddings so that the story went the rounds in twelve kingdoms.
helge-hal-in-blue-hill,"""Spin, span, spun, Now our tale is done!"""
the-battle-of-the-birds,There was to be a great battle between all the creatures of the earth and the birds of the air.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"News of it went abroad, and the son of the king of Tethertown said that when the battle was fought he would be there to see it, and would bring back word who was to be king."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"But in spite of that, he was almost too late, and every fight had been fought save the last, which was between a snake and a great black raven."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Both struck hard, but in the end the snake proved the stronger, and would have twisted himself round the neck of the raven till he died had not the king's son drawn his sword, and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And when the raven beheld that his enemy was dead, he was grateful, and said: 'For thy kindness to me this day, I will show thee a sight. So come up now on the root of my two wings.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The king's son did as he was bid, and before the raven stopped flying, they had passed over seven bens and seven glens and seven mountain moors. ' Do you see that house yonder?' said the raven at last."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Go straight for it, for a sister of mine dwells there, and she will make you right welcome. And if she asks, ""Wert thou at the battle of the birds?"" answer that thou wert, and if she asks, ""Didst thou see my likeness?"" answer that thou sawest it, but be sure thou meetest me in the morning at this place.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The king's son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat of each meat, and drink of each drink, warm water for his feet, and a soft bed to lie in."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Thus it happened the next day, and the next, but on the fourth meeting, instead of meeting the raven, in his place the king's son found waiting for him the handsomest youth that ever was seen, with a bundle in his hand. ' Is there a raven hereabouts?' asked the king's son, and the youth answered: 'I am that raven, and I was delivered by thee from the spells that bound me, and in reward thou wilt get this bundle. Go back by the road thou camest, and lie as before, a night in each house, but be careful not to unloose the bundle till thou art in the place wherein thou wouldst most wish to dwell.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then the king's son set out, and thus it happened as it had happened before, till he entered a thick wood near his father's house."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"He had walked a long way and suddenly the bundle seemed to grow heavier; first he put it down under a tree, and next he thought he would look at it."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The string was easy to untie, and the king's son soon unfastened the bundle."
the-battle-of-the-birds,What was it he saw there?
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Why, a great castle with an orchard all about it, and in the orchard fruit and flowers and birds of very kind."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"It was all ready for him to dwell in, but instead of being in the midst of the forest, he did wish he had left the bundle unloosed till he had reached the green valley close to his father's palace."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Well, it was no use wishing, and with a sigh he glanced up, and beheld a huge giant coming towards him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Bad is the place where thou hast built thy house, king's son,' said the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'True; it is not here that I wish to be,' answered the king's son."
the-battle-of-the-birds,' What reward wilt thou give me if I put it back in the bundle?' asked the giant.
the-battle-of-the-birds,' What reward dost thou ask?' answered the king's son.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' The first boy thou hast when he is seven years old,' said the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If I have a boy thou shalt get him,' answered the king's son, and as he spoke the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Now take thy road, and I will take mine,' said the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' And if thou forgettest thy promise, I will remember it.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Light of heart the king's son went on his road, till he came to the green valley near his father's palace."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Slowly he unloosed the bundle, fearing lest he should find nothing but a heap of stones or rags."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"But no! all was as it had been before, and as he opened the castle door there stood within the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Enter, king's son,' said she, 'all is ready, and we will be married at once,' and so they were."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The maiden proved a good wife, and the king's son, now himself a king, was so happy that he forgot all about the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Seven years and a day had gone by, when one morning, while standing on the ramparts, he beheld the giant striding towards the castle."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then he remembered his promise, and remembered, too, that he had told the queen nothing about it."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Now he must tell her, and perhaps she might help him in his trouble."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The queen listened in silence to his tale, and after he had finished, she only said: 'Leave the matter between me and the giant,' and as she spoke, the giant entered the hall and stood before them."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Bring out your son,' cried he to the king, 'as you promised me seven years and a day since.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The king glanced at his wife, who nodded, so he answered: 'Let his mother first put him in order,' and the queen left the hall, and took the cook's son and dressed him in the prince's clothes, and led him up to the giant, who held his hand, and together they went out along the road."
the-battle-of-the-birds,They had not walked far when the giant stopped and stretched out a stick to the boy.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'If your father had that stick, what would he do with it?' asked he."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'If my father had that stick, he would beat the dogs and cats that steal the king's meat,' replied the boy."
the-battle-of-the-birds,' Thou art the cook's son!' cried the giant.
the-battle-of-the-birds,'Go home to thy mother'; and turning his back he strode straight to the castle.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If you seek to trick me this time, the highest stone will soon be the lowest,' said he, and the king and queen trembled, but they could not bear to give up their boy. ' The butler's son is the same age as ours,' whispered the queen; 'he will not know the difference,' and she took the child and dressed him in the prince's clothes, and the giant let him away along the road."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Before they had gone far he stopped, and held out a stick."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'If thy father had that rod, what would he do with it?' asked the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' He would beat the dogs and cats that break the king's glasses,' answered the boy."
the-battle-of-the-birds,'Thou art the son of the butler!' cried the giant.
the-battle-of-the-birds,'Go home to thy mother'; and turning round he strode back angrily to the castle.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Bring out thy son at once,' roared he, 'or the stone that is highest will be lowest,' and this time the real prince was brought."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"But though his parents wept bitterly and fancied the child was suffering all kinds of dreadful things, the giant treated him like his own son, though he never allowed him to see his daughters."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The boy grew to be a big boy, and one day the giant told him that he would have to amuse himself alone for many hours, as he had a journey to make."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"So the boy wandered to the top of the castle, where he had never been before."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"There he paused, for the sound of music broke upon his ears, and opening a door near him, he beheld a girl sitting by the window, holding a harp."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' Haste and begone, I see the giant close at hand,' she whispered hurriedly, 'but when he is asleep, return hither, for I would speak with thee.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And the prince did as he was bid, and when midnight struck he crept back to the top of the castle."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'To-morrow,' said the girl, who was the giant's daughter, 'to-morrow thou wilt get the choice of my two sisters to marry, but thou must answer that thou wilt not take either, but only me. This will anger him greatly, for he wishes to betroth me to the son of the king of the Green City, whom I like not at all.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then they parted, and on the morrow, as the girl had said, the giant called his three daughters to him, and likewise the young prince to whom he spoke."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Now, O son of the king of Tethertown, the time has come for us to part. Choose one of my two elder daughters to wife, and thou shalt take her to your father's house the day after the wedding.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Give me the youngest instead,' replied the youth, and the giant's face darkened as he heard him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Three things must thou do first,' said he. ' Say on, I will do them,' replied the prince, and the giant left the house, and bade him follow to the byre, where the cows were kept."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'For a hundred years no man has swept this byre,' said the giant, 'but if by nightfall, when I reach home, thou has not cleaned it so that a golden apple can roll through it from end to end, thy blood shall pay for it.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"All day long the youth toiled, but he might as well have tried to empty the ocean."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"At length, when he was so tired he could hardly move, the giant's youngest daughter stood in the doorway."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Lay down thy weariness,' said she, and the king's son, thinking he could only die once, sank on the floor at her bidding, and fell sound asleep."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"When he woke the girl had disappeared, and the byre was so clean that a golden apple could roll from end to end of it."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"He jumped up in surprise, and at that moment in came the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Hast thou cleaned the byre, king's son?' asked he."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I have cleaned it,' answered he. ' Well, since thou wert so active to-day, to-morrow thou wilt thatch this byre with a feather from every different bird, or else thy blood shall pay for it,' and he went out."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Before the sun was up, the youth took his bow and his quiver and set off to kill the birds."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Off to the moor he went, but never a bird was to be seen that day."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"At last he got so tired with running to and fro that he gave up heart. ' There is but one death I can die,' thought he."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then at midday came the giant's daughter. ' Thou art tired, king's son?' asked she."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I am,' answered he; 'all these hours have I wandered, and there fell but these two blackbirds, both of one colour.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Lay down thy weariness on the grass,' said she, and he did as she bade him, and fell fast asleep."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"When he woke the girl had disappeared, and he got up, and returned to the byre."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"As he drew near, he rubbed his eyes hard, thinking he was dreaming, for there it was, beautifully thatched, just as the giant had wished."
the-battle-of-the-birds,At the door of the house he met the giant.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Hast thou thatched the byre, king's son?'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I have thatched it.' ' Well, since thou hast been so active to-day, I have something else for thee! Beside the loch thou seest over yonder there grows a fir tree. On the top of the fir tree is a magpie's nest, and in the nest are five eggs. Thou wilt bring me those eggs for breakfast, and if one is cracked or broken, thy blood shall pay for it.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Before it was light next day, the king's son jumped out of bed and ran down to the loch."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The tree was not hard to find, for the rising sun shone red on the trunk, which was five hundred feet from the ground to its first branch."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Time after time he walked round it, trying to find some knots, however small, where he could put his feet, but the bark was quite smooth, and he soon saw that if he was to reach the top at all, it must be by climbing up with his knees like a sailor."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"But then he was a king's son and not a sailor, which made all the difference."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"However, it was no use standing there staring at the fir, at least he must try to do his best, and try he did till his hands and knees were sore, for as soon as he had struggled up a few feet, he slid back again."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Once he climbed a little higher than before, and hope rose in his heart, then down he came with such force that his hands and knees smarted worse than ever."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'This is no time for stopping,' said the voice of the giant's daughter, as he leant against the trunk to recover his breath."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' Alas! I am no sooner up than down,' answered he. ' Try once more,' said she, and she laid a finger against the tree and bade him put his foot on it."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then she placed another finger a little higher up, and so on till he reached the top, where the magpie had built her nest."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Make haste now with the nest,' she cried, 'for my father's breath is burning my back,' and down he scrambled as fast as he could, but the girl's little finger had caught in a branch at the top, and she was obliged to leave it there."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"But she was too busy to pay heed to this, for the sun was getting high over the hills."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Listen to me,' she said."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'This night my two sisters and I will be dressed in the same garments, and you will not know me. But when my father says 'Go to thy wife, king's son,' come to the one whose right hand has no little finger.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"So he went and gave the eggs to the giant, who nodded his head."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Make ready for thy marriage,' cried he, 'for the wedding shall take place this very night, and I will summon thy bride to greet thee.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then his three daughters were sent for, and they all entered dressed in green silk of the same fashion, and with golden circlets round their heads."
the-battle-of-the-birds,The king's son looked from one to another.
the-battle-of-the-birds,Which was the youngest?
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Suddenly his eyes fell on the hand of the middle one, and there was no little finger."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Thou hast aimed well this time too,' said the giant, as the king's son laid his hand on her shoulder, 'but perhaps we may meet some other way'; and though he pretended to laugh, the bride saw a gleam in his eye which warned her of danger."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The wedding took place that very night, and the hall was filled with giants and gentlemen, and they danced till the house shook from top to bottom."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"At last everyone grew tired, and the guests went away, and the king's son and his bride were left alone."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'If we stay here till dawn my father will kill thee,' she whispered, 'but thou art my husband and I will save thee, as I did before,' and she cut an apple into nine pieces, and put two pieces at the head of the bed, and two pieces at the foot, and two pieces at the door of the kitchen, and two at the big door, and one outside the house."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And when this was done, and she heard the giant snoring, she and the king's son crept out softly and stole across to the stable, where she led out the blue-grey mare and jumped on its back, and her husband mounted behind her."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Not long after, the giant awoke. ' Are you asleep?' asked he."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Not yet,' answered the apple at the head of the bed, and the giant turned over, and soon was snoring as loudly as before."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"By and bye he called again. ' Are you asleep?' 'Not yet,' said the apple at the foot of the bed, and the giant was satisfied."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"After a while, he called a third time, 'Are you asleep?' 'Not yet,' replied the apple in the kitchen, but when in a few minutes, he put the question for the fourth time and received an answer from the apple outside the house door, he guessed what had happened, and ran to the room to look for himself."
the-battle-of-the-birds,The bed was cold and empty!
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'My father's breath is burning my back,' cried the girl, 'put thy hand into the ear of the mare, and whatever thou findest there, throw it behind thee.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And in the mare's ear there was a twig of sloe tree, and as he threw it behind him there sprung up twenty miles of thornwood so thick that scarce a weasel could go through it."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And the giant, who was striding headlong forwards, got caught in it, and it pulled his hair and beard."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'This is one of my daughter's tricks,' he said to himself, 'but if I had my big axe and my wood-knife, I would not be long making a way through this,' and off he went home and brought back the axe and the wood-knife."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"It took him but a short time to cut a road through the blackthorn, and then he laid the axe and the knife under a tree."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I will leave them there till I return,' he murmured to himself, but a hoodie crow, which was sitting on a branch above, heard him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If thou leavest them,' said the hoodie, 'we will steal them.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'You will,' answered the giant, 'and I must take them home.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"So he took them home, and started afresh on his journey."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' My father's breath is burning my back,' cried the girl at midday."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Put thy finger in the mare's ear and throw behind thee whatever thou findest in it,' and the king's son found a splinter of grey stone, and threw it behind him, and in a twinkling twenty miles of solid rock lay between them and the giant."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'My daughter's tricks are the hardest things that ever met me,' said the giant, 'but if I had my lever and my crowbar, I would not be long in making my way through this rock also,' but as he had got them, he had to go home and fetch them."
the-battle-of-the-birds,Then it took him but a short time to hew his way through the rock.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I will leave the tools here,' he murmured aloud when he had finished."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If thou leavest them, we will steal them,' said a hoodie who was perched on a stone above him, and the giant answered: 'Steal them if thou wilt; there is no time to go back.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'My father's breath is burning my back,' cried the girl; 'look in the mare's ear, king's son, or we are lost,' and he looked, and found a tiny bladder full of water, which he threw behind him, and it became a great lock."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And the giant, who was striding on so fast, could not stop himself, and he walked right into the middle and was drowned."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The blue-grey mare galloped on like the wind, and the next day the king's son came in sight of his father's house."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Get down and go in,' said the bride, 'and tell them that thou hast married me. But take heed that neither man nor beast kiss thee, for then thou wilt cease to remember me at all.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I will do thy bidding,' answered he, and left her at the gate."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"All who met him bade him welcome, and he charged his father and mother not to kiss him, but as he greeted them his old greyhound leapt on his neck, and kissed him on the mouth."
the-battle-of-the-birds,And after that he did not remember the giant's daughter.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"All that day she sat on a well which was near the gate, waiting, waiting, but the king's son never came."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"In the darkness she climbed up into an oak tree that shadowed the well, and there she lay all night, waiting, waiting."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"On the morrow, at midday, the wife of a shoemaker who dwelt near the well went to draw water for her husband to drink, and she saw the shadow of the girl in the tree, and thought it was her own shadow."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'How handsome I am, to be sure,' said she, gazing into the well, and as she stopped to behold herself better, the jug struck against the stones and broke in pieces, and she was forced to return to her husband without the water, and this angered him. ' Thou hast turned crazy,' said he in wrath."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Go thou, my daughter, and fetch me a drink,' and the girl went, and the same thing befell her as had befallen her mother."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Where is the water?' asked the shoemaker, when she came back, and as she held nothing save the handle of the jug he went to the well himself."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"He too saw the reflection of the woman in the tree, but looked up to discover whence it came, and there above him sat the most beautiful woman in the world."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Come down,' he said, 'for a while thou canst stay in my house,' and glad enough the girl was to come."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Now the king of the country was about to marry, and the young men about the court thronged the shoemaker's shop to buy fine shoes to wear at the wedding."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' Thou hast a pretty daughter,' said they when they beheld the girl sitting at work."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' Pretty she is,' answered the shoemaker, 'but no daughter of mine.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I would give a hundred pounds to marry her,' said one. ' And I,' ' And I,' cried the others."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'That is no business of mine,' answered the shoemaker, and the young men bade him ask her if she would choose one of them for a husband, and to tell them on the morrow."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then the shoemaker asked her, and the girl said that she would marry the one who would bring his purse with him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"So the shoemaker hurried to the youth who had first spoken, and he came back, and after giving the shoemaker a hundred pounds for his news, he sought the girl, who was waiting for him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,'Is it thou?' inquired she.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I am thirsty, give me a drink from the well that is yonder.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And he poured out the water, but he could not move from the place where he was; and there he stayed till many hours had passed by."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Take away that foolish boy,' cried the girl to the shoemaker at last, 'I am tired of him,' and then suddenly he was able to walk, and betook himself to his home, but he did not tell the others what had happened to him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Next day there arrived one of the other young men, and in the evening, when the shoemaker had gone out and they were alone, she said to him, 'See if the latch is on the door.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"The young man hastened to do her bidding, but as soon as he touched the latch, his fingers stuck to it, and there he had to stay for many hours, till the shoemaker came back, and the girl let him go."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Hanging his head, he went home, but he told no one what had befallen him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then was the turn of the third man, and his foot remained fastened to the floor, till the girl unloosed it."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"And thankfully, he ran off, and was not seen looking behind him."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'Take the purse of gold,' said the girl to the shoemaker, 'I have no need of it, and it will better thee.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,And the shoemaker took it and told the girl he must carry the shoes for the wedding up to the castle.
the-battle-of-the-birds,"'I would fain get a sight of the king's son before he marries,' sighed she. ' Come with me, then,' answered he; 'the servants are all my friends, and they will let you stand in the passage down which the king's son will pass, and all the company too.'"
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Up they went to the castle, and when the young men saw the girl standing there, they led her into the hall where the banquet was laid out and poured her out some wine."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"She was just raising the glass to drink when a flame went up out of it, and out of the flame sprang two pigeons, one of gold and one of silver."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"They flew round and round the head of the girl, when three grains of barley fell on the floor, and the silver pigeon dived down, and swallowed them."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If thou hadst remembered how I cleaned the byre, thou wouldst have given me my share,' cooed the golden pigeon, and as he spoke three more grains fell, and the silver pigeon ate them as before."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If thou hadst remembered how I thatched the byre, thou wouldst have given me my share,' cooed the golden pigeon again; and as he spoke three more grains fell, and for the third time they were eaten by the silver pigeon."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"' If thou hadst remembered how I got the magpie's nest, thou wouldst have given me my share,' cooed the golden pigeon."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"Then the king's son understood that they had come to remind him of what he had forgotten, and his lost memory came back, and he knew his wife, and kissed her."
the-battle-of-the-birds,"But as the preparations had been made, it seemed a pity to waste them, so they were married a second time, and sat down to the wedding feast."
the-four-gifts,"In the old land of Brittany, once called Cornwall, there lived a woman named Barbaik Bourhis, who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece Tephany."
the-four-gifts,"Early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too."
the-four-gifts,"Perhaps it might have been better for Barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things, for soon she grew to love money for its own sake, and only gave herself and Tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed."
the-four-gifts,"And as for poor people she positively hated them, and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world."
the-four-gifts,"Well, this being the sort of person Barbaik was, it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found Tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young Denis, who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of Plover."
the-four-gifts,"Seizing her niece by the arm, she pulled her sharply away, exclaiming: 'Are you not ashamed, girl, to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat, when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver, if you would let them?' 'Denis is a good workman, as you know very well,' answered Tephany, red with anger, 'and he puts by money too, and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself.'"
the-four-gifts,"'Nonsense,' cried Barbaik, 'he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred. I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back.'"
the-four-gifts,'What does fortune matter when one is young and strong?'
the-four-gifts,"asked Tephany, but her aunt, amazed at such words, would hardly let her finish."
the-four-gifts,"'What does fortune matter?' repeated Barbaik, in a shocked voice."
the-four-gifts,"'Is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money? If this is what you learn from Denis, I forbid you to speak to him, and I will have him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again. Now go and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry.'"
the-four-gifts,"Tephany did not dare to disobey, but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river."
the-four-gifts,"' She is harder than these rocks,' said the girl to herself, 'yes, a thousand times harder. For the rain at least can at last wear away the stone, but you might cry for ever, and she would never care. Talking to Denis is the only pleasure I have, and if I am not to see him I may as well enter a convent.'"
the-four-gifts,"Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank, and began to unfold the large packet of linen that had to be washed."
the-four-gifts,"The tap of a stick made her look up, and standing before her she saw a little old woman, whose face was strange to her."
the-four-gifts,"'You would like to sit down and rest, granny?' asked Tephany, pushing aside her bundle."
the-four-gifts,"'When the sky is all the roof you have, you rest where you will,' replied the old woman in trembling tones. ' Are you so lonely, then?' inquired Tephany, full of pity. ' Have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses?'"
the-four-gifts,The old woman shook her head.
the-four-gifts,"' They all died long, long ago,' she answered, 'and the only friends I have are strangers with kind hearts.'"
the-four-gifts,"The girl did not speak for a moment, then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner."
the-four-gifts,"'Take this,' she said; 'to-day at any rate you shall dine well,' and the old woman took it, gazing at Tephany the while."
the-four-gifts,"'Those who help others deserve to be helped,' she answered; 'your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from Plover. But cheer up, you are a good girl, and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day.'"
the-four-gifts,"'You?' cried Tephany, stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs, but the old woman did not hear her."
the-four-gifts,"'Take this long copper pin,' she went on, 'and every time you stick it in your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages. As long as the pin is in your dress you will be free, and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again.'"
the-four-gifts,"Then, rising, she nodded to Tephany and vanished."
the-four-gifts,"The girl stood where she was, as still as a stone."
the-four-gifts,If it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming.
the-four-gifts,"But by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her, but a fairy, wise in telling what would happen in the days to come."
the-four-gifts,"Then suddenly Tephany's eyes fell on the clothes, and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour."
the-four-gifts,"Next evening, at the moment when Denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse, Tephany stuck the pin in her dress, and at the very same instant Barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields, to the plot where the cabbages grew."
the-four-gifts,"With a heart as light as her footsteps, the girl ran from the house, and spent her evening happily with Denis."
the-four-gifts,And so it was for many days after that.
the-four-gifts,"Then, at last, Tephany began to notice something, and the something made her very sad."
the-four-gifts,"At first, Denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did, but when he had taught her all the songs he knew, and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man, he had nothing more to say to her, for he, like a great many other people, was fond of talking himself, but not of listening to any one else."
the-four-gifts,"Sometimes, indeed, he never came at all, and the next evening he would tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business, but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do."
the-four-gifts,"Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler, and one evening, when she had waited for him in vain, she put her water-pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring."
the-four-gifts,"On the path in front of her stood the fairy who had given her the pin, and as she glanced at Tephany she gave a little mischievous laugh and said: 'Why, my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before, in spite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases.'"
the-four-gifts,"'He has grown tired of me,' answered Tephany in a trembling voice, 'and he makes excuses to stay away. Ah! granny dear, it is not enough to be able to see him, I must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me. He is so clever, you know. Help me to be clever too.'"
the-four-gifts,'Is that what you want?' cried the old woman.
the-four-gifts,"'Well, take this feather and stick it in your hair, and you will be as wise as Solomon himself.'"
the-four-gifts,Blushing with pleasure Tephany went home and stuck the feather into the blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country.
the-four-gifts,"In a moment she heard Denis whistling gaily, and as her aunt was safely counting her cabbages, she hurried out to meet him."
the-four-gifts,The young man was struck dumb by her talk.
the-four-gifts,"There was nothing that she did not seem to know, and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of Brittany, but could compose them herself."
the-four-gifts,"Was this really the quiet girl who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her, or was it somebody else?"
the-four-gifts,"Perhaps she had gone suddenly mad, and there was an evil spirit inside her."
the-four-gifts,"But in any case, night after night he came back, only to find her growing wiser and wiser."
the-four-gifts,"Soon the neighbours whispered their surprise among themselves, for Tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her for her poor clothes, and many were the jokes she made about them."
the-four-gifts,"Of course they heard of her jests, and shook their heads saying: 'She is an ill-natured little cat, and the man that marries her will find that it is she who will hold the reins and drive the horse.'"
the-four-gifts,"It was not long before Denis began to agree with them, and as he always liked to be master wherever he went, he became afraid of Tephany's sharp tongue, and instead of laughing as before when she made fun of other people he grew red and uncomfortable, thinking that his turn would come next."
the-four-gifts,"So matters went on till one evening Denis told Tephany that he really could not stay a moment, as he had promised to go to a dance that was to be held in the next village."
the-four-gifts,"Tephany's face fell; she had worked hard all day, and had been counting on a quiet hour with Denis."
the-four-gifts,"She did her best to persuade him to remain with her, but he would not listen, and at last she grew angry. ' Oh, I know why you are so anxious not to miss the dance,' she said; 'it is because Aziliez of Pennenru will be there.'"
the-four-gifts,"Now Aziliez was the loveliest girl for miles round, and she and Denis had known each other from childhood."
the-four-gifts,"' Oh yes, Aziliez will be there,' answered Denis, who was quite pleased to see her jealous, 'and naturally one would go a long way to watch her dance.'"
the-four-gifts,'Go then!'
the-four-gifts,"cried Tephany, and entering the house she slammed the door behind her."
the-four-gifts,Lonely and miserable she sat down by the fire and stared into the red embers.
the-four-gifts,"Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put her head on her hands, and sobbed passionately."
the-four-gifts,"'What is the use of being clever when it is beauty that men want? That is what I ought to have asked for. But it is too late, Denis will never come back.'"
the-four-gifts,"'Since you wish it so much you shall have beauty,' said a voice at her side, and looking round she beheld the old woman leaning on her stick."
the-four-gifts,"' Fasten this necklace round your neck, and as long as you wear it you will be the most beautiful woman in the world,' continued the fairy."
the-four-gifts,"With a little shriek of joy Tephany took the necklace, and snapping the clasp ran to the mirror which hung in the corner."
the-four-gifts,"Ah, this time she was not afraid of Aziliez or of any other girl, for surely none could be as fair and white as she."
the-four-gifts,"And with the sight of her face a thought came to her, and putting on hastily her best dress and her buckled shoes she hurried off to the dance."
the-four-gifts,On the way she met a beautiful carriage with a young man seated in it. ' What a lovely maiden!'
the-four-gifts,"he exclaimed, as Tephany approached."
the-four-gifts,"'Why, there is not a girl in my own country that can be compared to her. She, and no other, shall be my bride.'"
the-four-gifts,"The carriage was large and barred the narrow road, so Tephany was forced, much against her will, to remain where she was."
the-four-gifts,"But she looked the young man full in the face as she answered: 'Go your way, noble lord, and let me go mine. I am only a poor peasant girl, accustomed to milk, and make hay and spin.'"
the-four-gifts,"'Peasant you may be, but I will make you a great lady,' said he, taking her hand and trying to lead her to the carriage."
the-four-gifts,"'I don't want to be a great lady, I only want to be the wife of Denis,' she replied, throwing off his hand and running to the ditch which divided the road from the cornfield, where he hoped to hide."
the-four-gifts,"Unluckily the young man guessed what she was doing, and signed to his attendants, who seized her and put her in the coach."
the-four-gifts,"The door was banged, and the horses whipped up into a gallop."
the-four-gifts,"At the end of an hour they arrived at a splendid castle, and Tephany, who would not move, was lifted out and carried into the hall, while a priest was sent for to perform the marriage ceremony."
the-four-gifts,"The young man tried to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as his wife, but Tephany did not listen to him, and looked about to see if there was any means by which she could escape."
the-four-gifts,It did not seem easy.
the-four-gifts,"The three great doors were closely barred, and the one through which she had entered shut with a spring, but her feather was still in her hair, and by its aid she detected a crack in the wooden panelling, through which a streak of light could be dimly seen."
the-four-gifts,"Touching the copper pin which fastened her dress, the girl sent every one in the hall to count the cabbages, while she herself passed through the little door, not knowing whither she was going."
the-four-gifts,"By this time night had fallen, and Tephany was very tired."
the-four-gifts,"Thankfully she found herself at the gate of a convent, and asked if she might stay there till morning."
the-four-gifts,"But the portress answered roughly that it was no place for beggars, and bade her begone, so the poor girl dragged herself slowly along the road, till a light and the bark of a dog told her that she was near a farm."
the-four-gifts,In front of the house was a group of people; two or three women and the sons of the farmer.
the-four-gifts,"When their mother heard Tephany's request to be given a bed the good wife's heart softened, and she was just going to invite her inside, when the young men, whose heads were turned by the girl's beauty, began to quarrel as to which should do most for her."
the-four-gifts,"From words they came to blows, and the women, frightened at the disturbance, pelted Tephany with insulting names."
the-four-gifts,"She quickly ran down the nearest path, hoping to escape them in the darkness of the trees, but in an instant she heard their footsteps behind her."
the-four-gifts,"Wild with fear her legs trembled under her, when suddenly she bethought herself of her necklace."
the-four-gifts,"With a violent effort she burst the clasp and flung it round the neck of a pig which was grunting in a ditch, and as she did so she heard the footsteps cease from pursuing her and run after the pig, for her charm had vanished."
the-four-gifts,"On she went, scarcely knowing where she was going, till she found herself, to her surprise and joy, close to her aunt's house."
the-four-gifts,"For several days she felt so tired and unhappy that she could hardly get through her work, and to make matters worse Denis scarcely ever came near her. ' He was too busy,' he said, 'and really it was only rich people who could afford to waste time in talking.'"
the-four-gifts,"As the days went on Tephany grew paler and paler, till everybody noticed it except her aunt."
the-four-gifts,"The water-pot was almost too heavy for her now, but morning and evening she carried it to the spring, though the effort to lift it to her shoulder was often too much for her."
the-four-gifts,"'How could I have been so foolish,' she whispered to herself, when she went down as usual at sunset."
the-four-gifts,"'It was not freedom to see Denis that I should have asked for, for he was soon weary of me, nor a quick tongue, for he was afraid of it, nor beauty, for that brought me nothing but trouble, but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others. Ah! if I only dared to beg this gift from the fairy, I should be wiser than before and know how to choose better.'"
the-four-gifts,"'Be satisfied,' said the voice of the old woman, who seemed to be standing unseen at Tephany's elbow."
the-four-gifts,"'If you look in your right-hand pocket when you go home you will find a small box. Rub your eyes with the ointment it contains, and you will see that you yourself contain a priceless treasure.'"
the-four-gifts,"Tephany did not in the least understand what she meant, but ran back to the farm as fast as she could, and began to fumble joyfully in her right-hand pocket."
the-four-gifts,"Sure enough, there was the little box with the precious ointment."
the-four-gifts,She was in the act of rubbing her eyes with it when Barbaik Bourhis entered the room.
the-four-gifts,"Ever since she had been obliged to leave her work and pass her time, she did not know why, in counting cabbages, everything had gone wrong, and she could not get a labourer to stay with her because of her bad temper."
the-four-gifts,"When, therefore, she saw her niece standing quietly before her mirror, Barbaik broke out: 'So this is what you do when I am out in the fields! Ah! it is no wonder if the farm is ruined. Are you not ashamed, girl, to behave so?'"
the-four-gifts,"Tephany tried to stammer some excuse, but her aunt was half mad with rage, and a box on the ears was her only answer."
the-four-gifts,"At this Tephany, hurt, bewildered and excited, could control herself no longer, and turning away burst into tears."
the-four-gifts,But what was her surprise when she saw that each tear-drop was a round and shining pearl.
the-four-gifts,"Barbaik, who also beheld this marvel, uttered a cry of astonishment, and threw herself on her knees to pick them up from the floor."
the-four-gifts,She was still gathering them when the door opened and in came Denis.
the-four-gifts,'Pearls! Are they really pearls?'
the-four-gifts,"he asked, falling on his knees also, and looking up at Tephany he perceived others still more beautiful rolling down the girl's cheeks."
the-four-gifts,"'Take care not to let any of the neighbours hear of it, Denis,' said Barbaik. ' Of course you shall have your share, but nobody else shall get a single one. Cry on, my dear, cry on,' she continued to Tephany."
the-four-gifts,"'It is for your good as well as ours,' and she held out her apron to catch them, and Denis his hat."
the-four-gifts,But Tephany could hardly bear any more.
the-four-gifts,"She felt half choked at the sight of their greediness, and wanted to rush from the hall, and though Barbaik caught her arm to prevent this, and said all sorts of tender words which she thought would make the girl weep the more, Tephany with a violent effort forced back her tears, and wiped her eyes."
the-four-gifts,"'Is she finished already?' cried Barbaik, in a tone of disappointment."
the-four-gifts,"' Oh, try again, my dear. Do you think it would do any good to beat her a little?'"
the-four-gifts,"she added to Denis, who shook his head."
the-four-gifts,'That is enough for the first time. I will go into the town and find out the value of each pearl.'
the-four-gifts,"'Then I will go with you,' said Barbaik, who never trusted anyone and was afraid of being cheated."
the-four-gifts,"So the two went out, leaving Tephany behind them."
the-four-gifts,"She sat quite still on her chair, her hands clasped tightly together, as if she was forcing something back."
the-four-gifts,"At last she raised her eyes, which had been fixed on the ground, and beheld the fairy standing in a dark corner by the hearth, observing her with a mocking look."
the-four-gifts,"The girl trembled and jumped up, then, taking the feather, the pin, and the box, she held them out to the old woman."
the-four-gifts,"'Here they are, all of them,' she cried; 'they belong to you. Let me never see them again, but I have learned the lesson that they taught me. Others may have riches, beauty and wit, but as for me I desire nothing but to be the poor peasant girl I always was, working hard for those she loves.'"
the-four-gifts,"'Yes, you have learned your lesson,' answered the fairy, 'and now you shall lead a peaceful life and marry the man you love. For after all it was not yourself you thought of but him.'"
the-four-gifts,"Never again did Tephany see the old woman, but she forgave Denis for selling her tears, and in time he grew to be a good husband, who did his own share of work."
the-bird-lover,"In a region of country where the forest and the prairie strived which should be the most beautiful-the open plain, with its free sunshine and winds and flowers, or the close wood, with its delicious twilight-walks and enamored haunts-there lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an old Indian."
the-bird-lover,"Although the country furnished an abundance of game, and whatever else a good heart could wish for, it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands."
the-bird-lover,"He made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power, for the purpose of killing them."
the-bird-lover,"The country had been once thickly peopled, but this Mudjee Monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices, that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness."
the-bird-lover,The secret of his success lay in his great speed.
the-bird-lover,"He had the power to assume the shape of any four-footed creature, and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy, to run with him."
the-bird-lover,"He had a beaten path on which he ran, leading around a large lake, and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning-post was the same."
the-bird-lover,"Whoever failed as every one had, yielded up his life at this post; and although he ran every day, no man was ever known to beat this evil genius; for whenever he was pressed hard, he changed himself into a fox, wolf, deer, or other swift-footed animal, and was thus able to leave his competitor behind."
the-bird-lover,"The whole country was in dread of this same Mudjee Monedo, and yet the young men were constantly running with him; for if they refused, he called them cowards, which was a reproach they could not bear."
the-bird-lover,They would rather die than be called cowards.
the-bird-lover,"To keep up his sport, the manito made light of these deadly foot-matches, and instead of assuming a braggart air, and going about in a boastful way, with the blood of such as he had overcome, upon his hands, he adopted very pleasing manners, and visited the lodges around the country as any other sweet-tempered and harmless old Indian might."
the-bird-lover,"His secret object in these friendly visits was to learn whether the young boys were getting old enough to run with him; he kept a very sharp eye upon their growth, and the day he thought them ready, he did not fail to challenge them to a trial on his racing-ground."
the-bird-lover,There was not a family in all that beautiful region which had not in this way been visited and thinned out; and the manito had quite naturally come to be held in abhorrence by all the Indian mothers in the country.
the-bird-lover,"It happened that there lived near him a poor widow woman, whose husband and seven sons he had made way with; and she was now living with an only daughter, and a son of ten or twelve years old."
the-bird-lover,"This widow was very poor and feeble, and she suffered so much for lack of food and other comforts of the lodge, that she would have been glad to die, but for her daughter and her little son."
the-bird-lover,"The Mudjee Monedo had already visited her lodge to observe whether the boy was sufficiently grown to be challenged to the race; and so crafty in his approaches and so soft in his manners was the monedo, that the mother feared that he would yet decoy the son and make way with him as he had done with his father and his seven brothers, in spite of all her struggles to save him."
the-bird-lover,And yet she strove with all her might to strengthen her son in every good course.
the-bird-lover,"She taught him, as best she could, what was becoming for the wise hunter and the brave warrior."
the-bird-lover,She remembered and set before him all that she could recall of the skill and the craft of his father and his brothers who were lost.
the-bird-lover,"The widow woman also instructed her daughter in whatever could make her useful as a wife; and in the leisure-time of the lodge, she gave her lessons in the art of working with the quills of porcupine, and bestowed on her such other accomplishments as should make her an ornament and a blessing to her husband's household."
the-bird-lover,"The daughter, Minda by name, was kind and obedient to her mother, and never failed in her duty."
the-bird-lover,"Their lodge stood high up on the banks of a lake, which gave them a wide prospect of country, embellished with groves and open fields, which waved with the blue light of their long grass, and made, at all hours of sun and moon, a cheerful scene to look upon."
the-bird-lover,"Across this beautiful prairie, Minda had one morning made her way to gather dry limbs for their fire; for she disdained no labor of the lodge."
the-bird-lover,"And while enjoying the sweetness of the air and the green beauty of the woods, she strolled far away."
the-bird-lover,"She had come to a bank, painted with flowers of every hue, and was reclining on its fragrant couch, when a bird, of red and deep-blue plumage softly blended, alighted on a branch near by, and began to pour forth its carol."
the-bird-lover,"It was a bird of strange character, such as she had never before seen."
the-bird-lover,"Its first note was so delicious to the ear of Minda, and it so pierced to her young heart, that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound."
the-bird-lover,"It seemed like the human voice, forbidden to speak, and uttering its language through this wild wood-chant with a mournful melody, as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible."
the-bird-lover,"The voice of the bird rose and fell, and circled round and round, but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes, they seemed ever to have their center where Minda sat; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird, that sat in his red and deep-blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank."
the-bird-lover,"The poor bird strove more and more with his voice, and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to Minda's ear, till at last she could not refrain from saying, ""What aileth thee, sad bird?"""
the-bird-lover,"As if he had but waited to be spoken to, the bird left his branch, and alighting upon the bank, smiled on Minda, and, shaking his shining plumage, answered: ""I am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage. I have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the Indian girls, but none ever heeded my voice till you. Will you be mine?"""
the-bird-lover,"he added, and poured forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene, and fairly entranced the young Minda, who sat silent, as if she feared to break the charm by speech."
the-bird-lover,"The bird, approaching nearer, asked her, if she loved him, to get her mother's consent to their marriage."
the-bird-lover,"""I shall be free then,"" said the bird, ""and you shall know me as I am."""
the-bird-lover,"Minda lingered, and listened to the sweet voice of the bird in its own forest notes, or filling each pause with gentle human discourse; questioning her as to her home, her family, and the little incidents of her daily life."
the-bird-lover,"She returned to the lodge later than usual, but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her."
the-bird-lover,"She returned again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood; and everyday she listened to the song and the discourse of her bird admirer with more pleasure, and he every day besought her to speak to her mother of the marriage."
the-bird-lover,"This she could not, however, muster heart and courage to do."
the-bird-lover,"At last the widow began herself to have a suspicion that her daughter's heart was in the wood, from her long delays in returning, and the little success she had in gathering the fire-branches for which she went in search."
the-bird-lover,"In answer to her mother's questions, Minda revealed the truth, and made known her lover's request."
the-bird-lover,"The mother, considering the lonely and destitute condition of her little household, gave her consent."
the-bird-lover,"The daughter, with light steps, hastened with the news to the wood."
the-bird-lover,"The bird lover of course heard it with delight, and fluttered through the air in happy circles, and poured forth a song of joy which thrilled Minda to the heart."
the-bird-lover,"He said that he would come to the lodge at sunset, and immediately took wing, while Minda hung fondly upon his flight, till he was lost far away in the blue sky."
the-bird-lover,"With the twilight the bird lover, whose name was Monedowa, appeared at the door of the lodge, as a hunter, with a red plume and a mantle of blue upon his shoulders."
the-bird-lover,"He addressed the widow as his friend, and she directed him to sit down beside her daughter, and they were regarded as man and wife."
the-bird-lover,"Early on the following morning, he asked for the bow and arrows of those who had been slain by the wicked manito, and went out a-hunting."
the-bird-lover,"As soon as he had got out of sight of the lodge, he changed himself into the wood-bird, as he had been before his marriage, and took his flight through the air."
the-bird-lover,"Although game was scarce in the neighborhood of the widow's lodge, Monedowa returned at evening, in his character of a hunter, with two deer."
the-bird-lover,"This was his daily practice, and the widow's family never more lacked for food."
the-bird-lover,"It was noticed, however, that Monedowa himself ate but little, and that of a peculiar kind of meat, flavored with berries, which, with other circumstances, convinced them that he was not as the Indian people around him."
the-bird-lover,"In a few days his mother-in-law told him that the manito would come to pay them a visit, to see how the young man, her son, prospered."
the-bird-lover,Monedowa answered that he should on that day be absent.
the-bird-lover,"When the time arrived, he flew upon a tall tree, overlooking the lodge, and took his station there as the wicked manito passed in."
the-bird-lover,"The mudjee monedo cast sharp glances at the scaffolds so well laden with meat, and as soon as he had entered, he said, ""Why, who is it that is furnishing you with meat so plentifully?"""
the-bird-lover,"""No one,"" she answered, ""but my son; he is just beginning to kill deer."""
the-bird-lover,"""No, no,"" he retorted; ""some one is living with you."""
the-bird-lover,"""Kaween, no indeed,"" replied the widow; ""you are only making sport of my hapless condition. Who do you think would come and trouble themselves about me?"""
the-bird-lover,"""Very well,"" answered the manito, ""I will go; but on such a day I will again visit you, and see who it is that furnishes the meat, and whether it is your son or not."""
the-bird-lover,"He had no sooner left the lodge and got out of sight, than the son-in-law made his appearance with two more deer."
the-bird-lover,"On being made acquainted with the conduct of the manito, ""Very well,"" he said, ""I will be at home the next time, to see him."""
the-bird-lover,Both the mother and the wife urged Monedowa to be aware of the manito.
the-bird-lover,"They made known to him all of his cruel courses, and assured him that no man could escape from his power."
the-bird-lover,"""No matter,"" said Monedowa; ""if he invites me to the race-ground, I will not be backward. What follows, may teach him, my mother, to show pity on the vanquished, and not to trample on the widow and those who are without fathers."""
the-bird-lover,"When the day of the visit of the manito arrived, Monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces of meat, which he pointed out to her, together with two or three buds of the birch-tree, which he requested her to put in the pot."
the-bird-lover,"He directed also that the manito should be hospitably received, as if he had been just the kind-hearted old Indian he professed to be."
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa then dressed himself as a warrior, embellishing his visage with tints of red, to show that he was prepared for either war or peace."
the-bird-lover,"As soon as the mudjee monedo arrived, he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before; but he dissembled, as usual, and, with a gentle laugh, said to the widow, ""Did I not tell you that some one was staying with you, for I knew your son was too young to hunt."""
the-bird-lover,"The widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him, inasmuch as he was a manito, and must have known before he asked."
the-bird-lover,"The manito was very pleasant with Monedowa, and after much other discourse, in a gentle-spoken voice, he invited him to the racing-ground, saying it was a manly amusement, that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors, and that he should himself be pleased to run with him."
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa would have excused himself, saying that he knew nothing of running."
the-bird-lover,"""Why,"" replied the mudjee monedo, trembling in every limb as he spoke, ""don't you see how old I look, while you are young and full of life. We must at least run a little to amuse others."""
the-bird-lover,"""Be it so, then,"" replied Monedowa."
the-bird-lover,"""I will oblige you. I will go in the morning."""
the-bird-lover,"Pleased with his crafty success, the manito would have now taken his leave, but he was pressed to remain and partake of their hospitality."
the-bird-lover,The meal was immediately prepared.
the-bird-lover,But one dish was used.
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa partook of it first, to show his guest that he need not fear, saying at the same time, ""It is a feast, and as we seldom meet, we must eat all that is placed on the dish, as a mark of gratitude to the Great Spirit for permitting me to kill animals, and for the pleasure of seeing you, and partaking of it with you."""
the-bird-lover,"They ate and talked, on this and that, until they had nearly dispatched the meal, when the manito took up the dish and drank off the broth at a breath."
the-bird-lover,On setting it down he immediately turned his head and commenced coughing with great violence.
the-bird-lover,"The old body in which he had disguised himself was well-nigh shaken in pieces, for he had, as Monedowa expected, swallowed a grain of the birch-bud, and this, which relished to himself as being of the bird nature, greatly distressed the old manito, who partook of the character of an animal, or four-footed thing."
the-bird-lover,"He was at last put to such confusion of face by his constant coughing, that he was enforced to leave, saying, or rather hiccoughing as he left the lodge, that he should look for the young man at the racing-ground in the morning."
the-bird-lover,"When the morning came, Monedowa was early astir, oiling his limbs and enameling his breast and arms with red and blue, resembling the plumage in which he had first appeared to Minda."
the-bird-lover,Upon his brow he placed a tuft of feathers of the same shining tints.
the-bird-lover,"By his invitation his wife, Minda, the mother and her young son, attended Monedowa to the manito's racing-ground."
the-bird-lover,"The lodge of the manito stood upon a high ground, and near it stretched out a long row of other lodges, said to be possessed by wicked kindred of his, who shared in the spoils of his cruelty."
the-bird-lover,"As soon as the young hunter and his party approached, the inmates appeared at their lodge-doors and cried out: ""We are visited."""
the-bird-lover,"At this cry, the mudjee monedo came forth and descended with his companions to the starting-post on the plain."
the-bird-lover,"From this the course could be seen, winding in a long girdle about the lake; and as they were now all assembled, the old manito began to speak of the race, belted himself up and pointed to the post, which was an upright pillar of stone."
the-bird-lover,"""But before we start,"" said the manito, ""I wish it to be understood that when men run with me I make a wager, and I expect them to abide by it-life against life."""
the-bird-lover,"""Very well-be it so,"" answered Monedowa."
the-bird-lover,"""We shall see whose head is to be dashed against the stone."""
the-bird-lover,"""We shall,"" rejoined the mudjee monedo."
the-bird-lover,"""I am very old, but I shall try and make a run."""
the-bird-lover,"""Very well,"" again rejoined Monedowa; ""I hope we shall both stand to our bargain."""
the-bird-lover,"""Good!"" said the old manito; and he at the same time cast a sly glance at the young hunter, and rolled his eyes toward where stood the pillar of stone."
the-bird-lover,"""I am ready,"" said Monedowa."
the-bird-lover,"The starting shout was given, and they set off at high speed, the manito leading, and Monedowa pressing closely after."
the-bird-lover,"As he closed upon him, the old manito began to show his power, and changing himself into a fox he passed the young hunter with ease, and went leisurely along."
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa now, with a glance upward, took the shape of the strange bird of red and deep-blue plumage, and with one flight, lighting at some distance ahead of the manito, resumed his mortal shape."
the-bird-lover,"When the mudjee monedo espied his competitor before him, ""Whoa! whoa!"""
the-bird-lover,"he exclaimed; ""this is strange;"" and he immediately changed himself into a wolf, and sped past Monedowa."
the-bird-lover,"As he galloped by, Monedowa heard a noise from his throat, and he knew that he was still in distress from the birch-bud which he had swallowed at his mother-in-law's lodge."
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa again took wing, and, shooting into the air, he descended suddenly with great swiftness, and took the path far ahead of the old manito."
the-bird-lover,"As he passed the wolf he whispered in his ear: ""My friend, is this the extent of your speed?"""
the-bird-lover,"The manito began to be troubled with bad forebodings, for, on looking ahead, he saw the young hunter in his own manly form, running along at leisure."
the-bird-lover,"The mudjee monedo, seeing the necessity of more speed, now passed Monedowa in the shape of a deer."
the-bird-lover,"They were now far around the circle of the lake, and fast closing in upon the starting-post, when Monedowa, putting on his red and blue plumage, glided along the air and alighted upon the track far in advance."
the-bird-lover,"To overtake him, the old manito assumed the shape of the buffalo; and he pushed on with such long gallops that he was again the foremost on the course."
the-bird-lover,"The buffalo was the last change he could make, and it was in this form that he had most frequently conquered."
the-bird-lover,"The young hunter, once more a bird, in the act of passing the manito, saw his tongue lolling from his mouth with fatigue."
the-bird-lover,"""My friend,"" said Monedowa, ""is this all your speed?"""
the-bird-lover,The manito made no answer.
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa had resumed his character of a hunter, and was within a run of the winning-post, when the wicked manito had nearly overtaken him."
the-bird-lover,"""Bakah! bakah! nejee!"""
the-bird-lover,"he called out to Monedowa; ""stop, my friend, I wish to talk to you."""
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa laughed aloud as he replied: ""I will speak to you at the starting-post. When men run with me I make a wager, and I expect them to abide by it-life against life."""
the-bird-lover,"One more flight as the blue bird with red wings, and Monedowa was so near to the goal that he could easily reach it in his mortal shape."
the-bird-lover,"Shining in beauty, his face lighted up like the sky, with tinted arms and bosom gleaming in the sun, and the parti-colored plume on his brow waving in the wind."
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa, cheered by a joyful shout from his own people, leaped to the post."
the-bird-lover,The manito came on with fear in his face.
the-bird-lover,"""My friend,"" he said, ""spare my life;"" and then added, in a low voice, as if he would not that the others should hear it, ""Give me to live."""
the-bird-lover,And he began to move off as if the request had been granted.
the-bird-lover,"""As you have done to others,"" replied Monedowa, ""so shall it be done to you."""
the-bird-lover,"And seizing the wicked manito, he dashed him against the pillar of stone."
the-bird-lover,"His kindred, who were looking on in horror, raised a cry of fear and fled away in a body to some distant land, whence they have never returned."
the-bird-lover,"The widow's family left the scene, and when they had all come out into the open fields, they walked on together until they had reached the fragrant bank and the evergreen wood, where the daughter had first encountered her bird lover."
the-bird-lover,"Monedowa turning to her, said: ""My mother, here we must part. Your daughter and myself must now leave you. The Good Spirit, moved with pity, has allowed me to be your friend. I have done that for which I was sent. I am permitted to take with me the one whom I love. I have found your daughter ever kind, gentle and just. She shall be my companion. The blessing of the Good Spirit be ever with you. Farewell, my mother-my brother, farewell."""
the-bird-lover,"While the widow woman was still lost in wonder at these words, Monedowa, and Minda his wife, changed at the same moment, rose into the air, as beautiful birds, clothed in shining colors of red and blue."
the-bird-lover,"They caroled together as they flew, and their songs were happy, and falling, falling, like clear drops, as they rose, and rose, and winged their way far upward, a delicious peace came into the mind of the poor widow woman, and she returned to her lodge deeply thankful at heart for all the goodness that had been shown to her by the Master of Life."
the-bird-lover,"From that day forth she never knew want, and her young son proved a comfort to her lodge, and the tuneful carol of Monedowa and Minda, as it fell from heaven, was a music always, go whither she would, sounding peace and joy in her ear."
the-king-of-the-ants,"Once upon a time there was a scholar, who wandered away from his home and went to Emmet village."
the-king-of-the-ants,There stood a house which was said to be haunted.
the-king-of-the-ants,Yet it was beautifully situated and surrounded by a lovely garden.
the-king-of-the-ants,So the scholar hired it.
the-king-of-the-ants,"One evening he was sitting over his books, when several hundred knights suddenly came galloping into the room."
the-king-of-the-ants,"They were quite tiny, and their horses were about the size of flies."
the-king-of-the-ants,They had hunting falcons and dogs about as large as gnats and fleas.
the-king-of-the-ants,"They came to his bed in the corner of the room, and there they held a great hunt, with bows and arrows: one could see it all quite plainly."
the-king-of-the-ants,"They caught a tremendous quantity of birds and game, and all this game was no larger than little grains of rice."
the-king-of-the-ants,"When the hunt was over, in came a long procession with banners and standards."
the-king-of-the-ants,"They wore swords at their side and bore spears in their hands, and came to a halt in the north-west corner of the room."
the-king-of-the-ants,They were followed by several hundred serving-men.
the-king-of-the-ants,"These brought with them curtains and covers, tents and tent-poles, pots and kettles, cups and plates, tables and chairs."
the-king-of-the-ants,"And after them some hundreds of other servants carried in all sorts of fine dishes, the best that land and water had to offer."
the-king-of-the-ants,"And several hundred more ran to and fro without stopping, in order to guard the roads and carry messages."
the-king-of-the-ants,The scholar gradually accustomed himself to the sight.
the-king-of-the-ants,Although the men were so very small he could distinguish everything quite clearly.
the-king-of-the-ants,"Before long, a bright colored banner appeared."
the-king-of-the-ants,Behind it rode a personage wearing a scarlet hat and garments of purple.
the-king-of-the-ants,He was surrounded by an escort of several thousands.
the-king-of-the-ants,Before him went runners with whips and rods to clear the way.
the-king-of-the-ants,"Then a man wearing an iron helmet and with a golden ax in his hand cried out in a loud voice: ""His Highness is graciously pleased to look at the fish in the Purple Lake!"""
the-king-of-the-ants,"Whereupon the one who wore the scarlet hat got down from his horse, and, followed by a retinue of several hundred men, approached the saucer which the scholar used for his writing-ink."
the-king-of-the-ants,Tents were put up on the edge of the saucer and a banquet was prepared.
the-king-of-the-ants,A great number of guests sat down to the table.
the-king-of-the-ants,Musicians and dancers stood ready.
the-king-of-the-ants,"There was a bright confusion of mingled garments of purple and scarlet, crimson and green."
the-king-of-the-ants,"Pipes and flutes, fiddles and cymbals sounded, and the dancers moved in the dance."
the-king-of-the-ants,"The music was very faint, and yet its melodies could be clearly distinguished."
the-king-of-the-ants,"All that was said, too, the table-talk and orders, questions and calls, could be quite distinctly heard."
the-king-of-the-ants,"After three courses, he who wore the scarlet hat said: ""Quick! Make ready the nets and lines for fishing!"""
the-king-of-the-ants,And at once nets were thrown out into the saucer which held the water in which the scholar dipped his brush.
the-king-of-the-ants,And they caught hundreds of thousands of fishes.
the-king-of-the-ants,"The one with the scarlet hat contented himself with casting a line in the shallow waters of the saucer, and caught a baker's dozen of red carp."
the-king-of-the-ants,"Then he ordered the head cook to cook the fish, and the most varied dishes were prepared with them."
the-king-of-the-ants,The odor of roasting fat and spices filled the whole room.
the-king-of-the-ants,"And then the wearer of the scarlet hat in his arrogance, decided to amuse himself at the scholar's expense."
the-king-of-the-ants,"So he pointed to him and said: ""I know nothing at all about the writings and customs of the saints and wise men, and still I am a king who is highly honored! Yonder scholar spends his whole life toiling over his books and yet he remains poor and gets nowhere. If he could make up his mind to serve me faithfully as one of my officials, I might allow him to partake of our meal."""
the-king-of-the-ants,"This angered the scholar, and he took his book and struck at them."
the-king-of-the-ants,"And they all scattered, wriggling and crawling out of the door."
the-king-of-the-ants,He followed them and dug up the earth in the place where they had disappeared.
the-king-of-the-ants,"And there he found an ants' nest as large as a barrel, in which countless green ants were wriggling around."
the-king-of-the-ants,So he built a large fire and smoked them out.
little-boy-blue,There once lived a poor widow who supported herself and her only son by gleaning in the fields the stalks of grain that had been missed by the reapers.
little-boy-blue,"Her little cottage was at the foot of a beautiful valley, upon the edge of the river that wound in and out among the green hills; and although poor, she was contented with her lot, for her home was pleasant and her lovely boy was a constant delight to her."
little-boy-blue,"He had big blue eyes, and fair golden curls, and he loved his good mother very dearly, and was never more pleased than when she allowed him to help her with her work."
little-boy-blue,"And so the years passed happily away till the boy was eight years old, but then the widow fell sick, and their little store of money melted gradually away."
little-boy-blue,"""I don't know what we shall do for bread,"" she said, kissing her boy with tears in her eyes, ""for I am not yet strong enough to work, and we have no money left."""
little-boy-blue,"""But I can work,"" answered the boy; ""and I'm sure if I go to the Squire up at the Hall he will give me something to do."""
little-boy-blue,"At first the widow was reluctant to consent to this, since she loved to keep her child at her side, but finally, as nothing else could be done, she decided to let him go to see the Squire."
little-boy-blue,"Being too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in his ragged clothes, she made him a new suit out of a pretty blue dress she had herself worn in happier times, and when it was finished and the boy dressed in it, he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale."
little-boy-blue,"For the bright blue jacket set off his curls to good advantage, and the color just matched the blue of his eyes."
little-boy-blue,"His trousers were blue, also, and she took the silver buckles from her own shoes and put them on his, that he might appear the finer."
little-boy-blue,And then she brushed his curls and placed his big straw hat upon them and sent him away with a kiss to see the Squire.
little-boy-blue,"It so happened that the great man was walking in his garden with his daughter Madge that morning, and was feeling in an especially happy mood, so that when he suddenly looked up and saw a little boy before him, he said, kindly, ""Well, my child, what can I do for you?"""
little-boy-blue,"""If you please, sir,"" said the boy, bravely, although he was frightened at meeting the Squire face to face, ""I want you to give me some work to do, so that I can earn money."""
little-boy-blue,"""Earn money!"" repeated the Squire, ""why do you wish to earn money?"""
little-boy-blue,"""To buy food for my mother, sir. We are very poor, and since she is no longer able to work for me I wish to work for her."""
little-boy-blue,"""But what can you do?"" asked the Squire; ""you are too small to work in the fields."""
little-boy-blue,"""I could earn something, sir, couldn't I?"""
little-boy-blue,"His tone was so pleading that mistress Madge was unable to resist it, and even the Squire was touched."
little-boy-blue,"The young lady came forward and took the boy's hand in her own, and pressing back his curls, she kissed his fair cheek."
little-boy-blue,"""You shall be our shepherd,"" she said, pleasantly, ""and keep the sheep out of the meadows and the cows from getting into the corn. You know, father,"" she continued, turning to the Squire, ""it was only yesterday you said you must get a boy to tend the sheep, and this little boy can do it nicely."""
little-boy-blue,"""Very well,"" replied the Squire, ""it shall be as you say, and if he is attentive and watchful he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and so really earn his money."""
little-boy-blue,"Then he turned to the child and said, ""Come to me in the morning, my little man, and I will give you a silver horn to blow, that you may call the sheep and the cows whenever they go astray. What is your name?"""
little-boy-blue,"""Oh, never mind his name, papa!"" broke in the Squire's daughter; ""I shall call him Little Boy Blue, since he is dressed in blue from head to foot, and his dress but matches his eyes. And you must give him a good wage, also, for surely no Squire before ever had a prettier shepherd boy than this."""
little-boy-blue,"""Very good,"" said the Squire, cheerfully, as he pinched his daughter's rosy cheek; ""be watchful, Little Boy Blue, and you shall be well paid."""
little-boy-blue,"Then Little Boy Blue thanked them both very sweetly and ran back over the hill and into the valley where his home lay nestled by the river-side, to tell the good news to his mother."
little-boy-blue,"The poor widow wept tears of joy when she heard his story, and smiled when he told her that his name was to be Little Boy Blue."
little-boy-blue,She knew the Squire was a kind master and would be good to her darling son.
little-boy-blue,"Early the next morning Little Boy Blue was at the Hall, and the Squire's steward gave him a new silver horn, that glistened brightly in the sunshine, and a golden cord to fasten it around his neck."
little-boy-blue,"And then he was given charge of the sheep and the cows, and told to keep them from straying into the meadowlands and the fields of grain."
little-boy-blue,"It was not hard work, but just suited to Little Boy Blue's age, and he was watchful and vigilant and made a very good shepherd boy indeed."
little-boy-blue,"His mother needed food no longer, for the Squire paid her son liberally and the Squire's daughter made a favorite of the small shepherd and loved to hear the call of his silver horn echoing amongst the hills."
little-boy-blue,"Even the sheep and the cows were fond of him, and always obeyed the sound of his horn; therefore the Squire's corn thrived finely, and was never trampled."
little-boy-blue,"Little Boy Blue was now very happy, and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health."
little-boy-blue,"After a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day; but she could not go far, because her limbs were too feeble to support her long, so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet Little Boy Blue as he came home from work in the evening."
little-boy-blue,"Then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him, and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps."
little-boy-blue,"But one day a great misfortune came upon them, since it is true that no life can be so happy but that sorrow will creep in to temper it."
little-boy-blue,"Little Boy Blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked, for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage."
little-boy-blue,"But when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight, and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears."
little-boy-blue,"Little Boy Blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother, her face white and drawn with suffering, and tears of anguish running down her cheeks."
little-boy-blue,"For she had slipped upon the stile and fallen, and her leg was broken!"
little-boy-blue,"Little Boy Blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman's face, and raised her head that she might drink."
little-boy-blue,"There were no neighbors, for the cottage stood all alone by the river, so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage."
little-boy-blue,"Fortunately, it was not far, and at last she was safely laid upon her bed."
little-boy-blue,Then Little Boy Blue began to think what he should do next.
little-boy-blue,"""Can I leave you alone while I go for the doctor, mamma?"""
little-boy-blue,"he asked, anxiously, as he held her clasped hands tightly in his two little ones."
little-boy-blue,His mother drew him towards her and kissed him.
little-boy-blue,"""Take the boat, dear,"" she said, ""and fetch the doctor from the village. I shall be patient till you return."""
little-boy-blue,Little Boy Blue rushed away to the river bank and unfastened the little boat; and then he pulled sturdily down the river until he passed the bend and came to the pretty village below.
little-boy-blue,"When he had found the doctor and told of his mother's misfortune, the good man promised to attend him at once, and very soon they were seated in the boat and on their way to the cottage."
little-boy-blue,"It was very dark by this time, but Little Boy Blue knew every turn and bend in the river, and the doctor helped him pull at the oars, so that at last they came to the place where a faint light twinkled through the cottage window."
little-boy-blue,"They found the poor woman in much pain, but the doctor quickly set and bandaged her leg, and gave her some medicine to ease her suffering."
little-boy-blue,It was nearly midnight when all was finished and the doctor was ready to start back to the village.
little-boy-blue,"""Take good care of your mother,"" he said to the boy, ""and don't worry about her, for it is not a bad break and the leg will mend nicely in time; but she will be in bed many days, and you must nurse her as well as you are able."""
little-boy-blue,"All through the night the boy sat by the bedside, bathing his mother's fevered brow and ministering to her wants."
little-boy-blue,"And when the day broke she was resting easily and the pain had left her, and she told Little Boy Blue he must go to his work."
little-boy-blue,"""For,"" said she, ""more than ever now we need the money you earn from the Squire, as my misfortune will add to the expenses of living, and we have the doctor to pay. Do not fear to leave me, for I shall rest quietly and sleep most of the time while you are away."""
little-boy-blue,"Little Boy Blue did not like to leave his mother all alone, but he knew of no one he could ask to stay with her; so he placed food and water by her bedside, and ate a little breakfast himself, and started off to tend his sheep."
little-boy-blue,"The sun was shining brightly, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees, and the crickets chirped just as[38] merrily as if this great trouble had not come to Little Boy Blue to make him sad."
little-boy-blue,"But he went bravely to his work, and for several hours he watched carefully; and the men at work in the fields, and the Squire's daughter, who sat embroidering upon the porch of the great house, heard often the sound of his horn as he called the straying sheep to his side."
little-boy-blue,"But he had not slept the whole night, and he was tired with his long watch at his mother's bedside, and so in spite of himself the lashes would droop occasionally over his blue eyes, for he was only a child, and children feel the loss of sleep more than older people."
little-boy-blue,"Still, Little Boy Blue had no intention of sleeping while he was on duty, and bravely fought against the drowsiness that was creeping over him."
little-boy-blue,"The sun shone very hot that day, and he walked to the shady side of a big haystack and sat down upon the ground, leaning his back against the stack."
little-boy-blue,"The cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him, and he watched them earnestly for a time, listening to the singing of the birds, and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers, and the far-away songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears."
little-boy-blue,"And before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast, and the golden head lay back upon the hay, and Little Boy Blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him."
little-boy-blue,"The sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused, waiting for the warning sound of the horn."
little-boy-blue,And the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast.
little-boy-blue,"But the silver horn was silent, and before long the cows were feeding upon the Squire's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows."
little-boy-blue,"The Squire himself was returning from a long, weary ride over his farms, and when he came to the cornfield and saw the cows trampling down the grain and feeding upon the golden stalks he was very angry."
little-boy-blue,"""Little Boy Blue!"""
little-boy-blue,"he cried; ""ho! Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn!"""
little-boy-blue,But there was no reply.
little-boy-blue,"He rode on a way and now discovered that the sheep were deep within the meadows, and that made him more angry still."
little-boy-blue,"""Here, Isaac,"" he said to a farmer's lad who chanced to pass by, ""where is Little Boy Blue?"""
little-boy-blue,"""He's under the hay-stack, your honor, fast asleep!"" replied Isaac with a grin, for he had passed that way and seen that the boy was lying asleep."
little-boy-blue,"""Will you go and wake him?"" asked the Squire; ""for he must drive out the sheep and the cows before they do more damage."""
little-boy-blue,"""Not I,"" replied Isaac, ""if I wake him he'll surely cry, for he is but a baby, and not fit to mind the sheep. But I myself will drive them out for your honor,"" and away he ran to do so, thinking that now the Squire would give him Little Boy Blue's place, and make him the shepherd boy, for Isaac had long coveted the position."
little-boy-blue,"The Squire's daughter, hearing the angry tones of her father's voice, now came out to see what was amiss, and when she heard that Little Boy Blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved, for she had loved the child for his pretty ways."
little-boy-blue,The Squire dismounted from his horse and came to where the boy was lying.
little-boy-blue,"""Awake!"" said he, shaking him by the shoulder, ""and depart from my lands, for you have betrayed my trust, and let the sheep and the cows stray into the fields and meadows!"""
little-boy-blue,"Little Boy Blue started up at once and rubbed his eyes; and then he did as Isaac prophesied, and began to weep bitterly, for his heart was sore that he had failed in his duty to the good Squire and so forfeited his confidence."
little-boy-blue,"But the Squire's daughter was moved by the child's tears, so she took him upon her lap and comforted him, asking, ""Why did you sleep, Little Boy Blue, when you should have watched the cows and the sheep?"""
little-boy-blue,"""My mother has broken her leg,"" answered the boy, between his sobs, ""and I did not sleep all last night, but sat by her bedside nursing her. And I tried hard not to fall asleep, but could not help myself;[41] and oh, Squire! I hope you will forgive me this once, for my poor mother's sake!"""
little-boy-blue,"""Where does your mother live?"" asked the Squire, in a kindly tone, for he had already forgiven Little Boy Blue."
little-boy-blue,"""In the cottage down by the river,"" answered the child; ""and she is all alone, for there is no one near to help us in our trouble."""
little-boy-blue,"""Come,"" said Mistress Madge, rising to her feet and taking his hand; ""lead us to your home, and we will see if we cannot assist your poor mother."""
little-boy-blue,"So the Squire and his daughter and Little Boy Blue all walked down to the little cottage, and the Squire had a long talk with the poor widow."
little-boy-blue,"And that same day a big basket of dainties was sent to the cottage, and Mistress Madge bade her own maid go to the widow and nurse her carefully until she recovered."
little-boy-blue,"So that after all Little Boy Blue did more for his dear mother by falling asleep than he could had he kept wide awake; for after his mother was well again the Squire gave them a pretty cottage to live in very near to the great house itself, and the Squire's daughter was ever afterward their good friend, and saw that they wanted for no comforts of life."
little-boy-blue,"And Little Boy Blue did not fall asleep again at his post, but watched the cows and the sheep faithfully for many years, until he grew up to manhood and had a farm of his own."
little-boy-blue,"He always said his mother's accident had brought him good luck, but I think it was rather his own loving heart and his devotion to his mother that made him friends."
little-boy-blue,For no one is afraid to trust a boy who loves to serve and care for his mother.
the-selfish-giant,"Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden."
the-selfish-giant,"It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass."
the-selfish-giant,"Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit."
the-selfish-giant,The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.
the-selfish-giant,"""How happy we are here!"""
the-selfish-giant,they cried to each other.
the-selfish-giant,One day the Giant came back.
the-selfish-giant,"He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years."
the-selfish-giant,"After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle."
the-selfish-giant,When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.
the-selfish-giant,"""What are you doing here?"""
the-selfish-giant,"he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away."
the-selfish-giant,"""My own garden is my own garden,"" said the Giant; ""any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself."""
the-selfish-giant,"So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board."
the-selfish-giant,He was a very selfish Giant.
the-selfish-giant,The poor children had now nowhere to play.
the-selfish-giant,"They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it."
the-selfish-giant,"They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside."
the-selfish-giant,"""How happy we were there,"" they said to each other."
the-selfish-giant,"Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds."
the-selfish-giant,Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.
the-selfish-giant,"The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom."
the-selfish-giant,"Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep."
the-selfish-giant,The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.
the-selfish-giant,"""Spring has forgotten this garden,"" they cried, ""so we will live here all the year round."""
the-selfish-giant,"The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver."
the-selfish-giant,"Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came."
the-selfish-giant,"He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down."
the-selfish-giant,"""This is a delightful spot,"" he said, ""we must ask the Hail on a visit."""
the-selfish-giant,So the Hail came.
the-selfish-giant,"Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go."
the-selfish-giant,"He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice."
the-selfish-giant,"""I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,"" said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; ""I hope there will be a change in the weather."""
the-selfish-giant,"But the Spring never came, nor the Summer."
the-selfish-giant,"The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none."
the-selfish-giant,"""He is too selfish,"" she said."
the-selfish-giant,"So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees."
the-selfish-giant,One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.
the-selfish-giant,It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.
the-selfish-giant,"It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world."
the-selfish-giant,"Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement."
the-selfish-giant,"""I believe the Spring has come at last,"" said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out."
the-selfish-giant,What did he see?
the-selfish-giant,He saw a most wonderful sight.
the-selfish-giant,"Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees."
the-selfish-giant,In every tree that he could see there was a little child.
the-selfish-giant,"And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads."
the-selfish-giant,"The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing."
the-selfish-giant,"It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter."
the-selfish-giant,"It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy."
the-selfish-giant,"He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly."
the-selfish-giant,"The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it."
the-selfish-giant,"""Climb up! little boy,"" said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny."
the-selfish-giant,And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.
the-selfish-giant,"""How selfish I have been!"""
the-selfish-giant,"he said; ""now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."""
the-selfish-giant,He was really very sorry for what he had done.
the-selfish-giant,"So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden."
the-selfish-giant,"But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again."
the-selfish-giant,"Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming."
the-selfish-giant,"And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree."
the-selfish-giant,"And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him."
the-selfish-giant,"And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring."
the-selfish-giant,"""It is your garden now, little children,"" said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall."
the-selfish-giant,And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.
the-selfish-giant,"All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye."
the-selfish-giant,"""But where is your little companion?"" he said: ""the boy I put into the tree."""
the-selfish-giant,The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.
the-selfish-giant,"""We don't know,"" answered the children; ""he has gone away."""
the-selfish-giant,"""You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,"" said the Giant."
the-selfish-giant,"But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad."
the-selfish-giant,"Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant."
the-selfish-giant,But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.
the-selfish-giant,"The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him."
the-selfish-giant,"""How I would like to see him!"""
the-selfish-giant,he used to say.
the-selfish-giant,"Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble."
the-selfish-giant,"He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden."
the-selfish-giant,"""I have many beautiful flowers,"" he said; ""but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."""
the-selfish-giant,One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.
the-selfish-giant,"He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting."
the-selfish-giant,"Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked."
the-selfish-giant,It certainly was a marvellous sight.
the-selfish-giant,In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.
the-selfish-giant,"Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved."
the-selfish-giant,"Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden."
the-selfish-giant,"He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child."
the-selfish-giant,"And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, ""Who hath dared to wound thee?"""
the-selfish-giant,"For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet."
the-selfish-giant,"""Who hath dared to wound thee?"" cried the Giant; ""tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."""
the-selfish-giant,"""Nay!"" answered the child; ""but these are the wounds of Love."""
the-selfish-giant,"""Who art thou?"" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child."
the-selfish-giant,"And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, ""You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."""
the-selfish-giant,"And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms."

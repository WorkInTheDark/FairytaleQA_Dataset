finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"There stands in the university town of Schonen, the town of Lund, the seat of the first archbishopric in all Scandinavia, a stately Romanic minster, with a large, handsome crypt beneath the choir."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"The opinion is universal that the minster will never be altogether finished, but that something will always be lacking about the structure."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"The reason is said to be as follows: When St. Lawrence came to Lund to preach the Gospel, he wanted to build a church; but did not know how he was to obtain the means to do so."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"While he was cudgelling his brains about it, a giant came to him and offered to build the church on condition that St. Lawrence tell him his name before the church was completed."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"But should St. Lawrence be unable to do so, the giant was to receive either the sun, the moon or St. Lawrence's eyes."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,The saint agreed to his proposal.
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"The building of the church made rapid progress, and ere long it was nearly finished."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"St. Lawrence thought ruefully about his prospects, for he did not know the giant's name; yet at the same time he did not relish losing his eyes."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"And it happened that while he was walking without the town, much concerned about the outcome of the affair, he grew weary, and sat down on a hill to rest."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"As he sat there he heard a child crying within the hill, and a woman's voice began to sing: ""Sleep, sleep, my baby dear, To-morrow your father, Finn, will be here; Then sun and moon you shall have from the skies To play with, or else St. Lawrence's eyes."""
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,When St. Lawrence heard that he was happy; for now he knew the giant's name.
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"He ran back quickly to town, and went to the church."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"There sat the giant on the roof, just about to set the last stone in place, when at that very moment the saint called out: ""Finn, Finn, Take care how you put the stone in!"""
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"Then the giant flung the stone from him, full of rage, said that the church should never be finished, and with that he disappeared."
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,Since then something has always been missing from the church.
finn-the-giant-and-the-minister-of-lund,"Others say that the giant and his wife rushed down into the crypt in their rage, and each seizing a column were about to tear down the church, when they were turned into stone, and may be seen to this day standing beside the columns they had grasped."

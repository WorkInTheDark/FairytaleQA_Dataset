old-dschang,Once upon a time there was a man who went by the name of Old Dschang.
old-dschang,"He lived in the country, near Yangdschou, as a gardener."
old-dschang,"His neighbor, named Sir We, held an official position in Yangdschou."
old-dschang,"Sir We had decided that it was time for his daughter to marry, so he sent for a match-maker and commissioned her to find a suitable husband."
old-dschang,"Old Dschang heard this, and was pleased."
old-dschang,"He prepared food and drink, entertained the match-maker, and told her to recommend him as a husband."
old-dschang,But the old match-maker went off scolding.
old-dschang,The next day he invited her to dinner again and gave her money.
old-dschang,"Then the old match-maker said: ""You do not know what you wish! Why should a gentleman's beautiful daughter condescend to marry a poor old gardener like yourself? Even though you had money to burn, your white hair would not match her black locks. Such a marriage is out of the question!"""
old-dschang,"But Old Dschang did not cease to entreat her: ""Make an attempt, just one attempt, to mention me! If they will not listen to you, then I must resign myself to my fate!"""
old-dschang,"The old match-maker had taken his money, so she could not well refuse, and though she feared being scolded, she mentioned him to Sir We."
old-dschang,He grew angry and wanted to throw her out of the house.
old-dschang,"""I knew you would not thank me,"" said she, ""but the old man urged it so that I could not refuse to mention his intention."""
old-dschang,"""Tell the old man that if this very day he brings me two white jade-stones, and four hundred ounces of yellow gold, then I will give him my daughter's hand in marriage."""
old-dschang,"But he only wished to mock the old man's folly, for he knew that the latter could not give him anything of the kind."
old-dschang,The match-maker went to Old Dschang and delivered the message.
old-dschang,And he made no objection; but at once brought the exact quantity of gold and jewels to Sir We's house.
old-dschang,"The latter was very much frightened and when his wife heard of it, she began to weep and wail loudly."
old-dschang,"But the girl encouraged her mother: ""My father has given his word now and cannot break it. I will know how to bear my fate."""
old-dschang,So Sir We's daughter was married to Old Dschang.
old-dschang,But even after the wedding the latter did not give up his work as a gardener.
old-dschang,"He spaded the field and sold vegetables as usual, and his wife had to fetch water and build the kitchen fire herself."
old-dschang,"But she did her work without false shame and, though her relatives reproached her, she continued to do so."
old-dschang,"Once an aristocratic relative visited Sir We and said: ""If you had really been poor, were there not enough young gentlemen in the neighborhood for your daughter? Why did you have to marry her to such a wrinkled old gardener? Now that you have thrown her away, so to speak, it would be better if both of them left this part of the country."""
old-dschang,Then Sir We prepared a banquet and invited his daughter and Old Dschang to visit him.
old-dschang,When they had had sufficient to eat and drink he allowed them to get an inkling of what was in his mind.
old-dschang,"Said Old Dschang: ""I have only remained here because I thought you would long for your daughter. But since you are tired of us, I will be glad to go. I have a little country house back in the hills, and we will set out for it early to-morrow morning."""
old-dschang,"The following morning, at break of dawn, Old Dschang came with his wife to say farewell."
old-dschang,"Sir We said: ""Should we long to see you at some later time, my son can make inquiries."""
old-dschang,Old Dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear.
old-dschang,He himself took his staff and walked after.
old-dschang,A few years passed without any news from either of them.
old-dschang,Then Sir We and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries.
old-dschang,When the latter got back in the hills he met a plow-boy who was plowing with two yellow steers.
old-dschang,"He asked him: ""Where is Old Dschang's country house?"""
old-dschang,"The plow-boy left the plow in the harrow, bowed and answered: ""You have been a long time coming, sir! The village is not far from here: I will show you the way."""
old-dschang,They crossed a hill.
old-dschang,"At the foot of the hill flowed a brook, and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill."
old-dschang,Gradually the landscape changed.
old-dschang,"From the top of the hill could be seen a valley, level in the middle, surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees, among which houses and towers peeped forth."
old-dschang,This was the country house of Old Dschang.
old-dschang,"Before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear, blue water."
old-dschang,They passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate.
old-dschang,"Here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion, and peacocks and cranes flew about."
old-dschang,From the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and of stringed instruments.
old-dschang,Crystal-clear tones rose to the clouds.
old-dschang,A messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor.
old-dschang,"Strange fragrances filled the air, and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl."
old-dschang,"Two maid-servants came forth to greet him, followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional."
old-dschang,"After them a man in a flowing turban, clad in scarlet silk, with red slippers, came floating along."
old-dschang,The guest saluted him.
old-dschang,"He was serious and dignified, and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh."
old-dschang,"At first We's son did not recognize him, but when he looked more closely, why it was Old Dschang!"
old-dschang,"The latter said with a smile: ""I am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming. Your sister is just combing her hair. She will welcome you in a moment."""
old-dschang,Then he had him sit down and drink tea.
old-dschang,"After a short time a maid-servant came and led him to the inner rooms, to his sister."
old-dschang,"The beams of her room were of sandalwood, the doors of tortoise-shell and the windows inlaid with blue jade; her curtains were formed of strings of pearls and the steps leading into the room of green nephrite."
old-dschang,"His sister was magnificently gowned, and far more beautiful than before."
old-dschang,"She asked him carelessly how he was getting along, and what her parents were doing; but was not very cordial."
old-dschang,After a splendid meal she had an apartment prepared for him.
old-dschang,"""My sister wishes to make an excursion to the Mountain of the Fairies,"" said Old Dschang to him."
old-dschang,"""We will be back about sunset, and you can rest until we return."""
old-dschang,"Then many-colored clouds rose in the courtyard, and dulcet music sounded on the air."
old-dschang,"Old Dschang mounted a dragon, while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes."
old-dschang,So they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction.
old-dschang,They did not return until after sunset.
old-dschang,"Old Dschang and his wife then said to him: ""This is an abode of the blessed. You cannot remain here overlong. To-morrow we will escort you back."""
old-dschang,"On the following day, when taking leave, Old Dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat."
old-dschang,"""Should you need money,"" said he, ""you can go to Yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old Wang's drug-shop. There you can collect ten million pieces of copper. This hat is the order for them."""
old-dschang,Then he ordered his plow-boy to take him home again.
old-dschang,"Quite a few of the folks at home, to whom he described his adventures, thought that Old Dschang must be a holy man, while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision."
old-dschang,After five or six years Sir We's money came to an end.
old-dschang,So his son took the straw hat to Yangdschou and there asked for old Wang.
old-dschang,"The latter just happened to be standing in his drug-shop, mixing herbs."
old-dschang,"When the son explained his errand he said: ""The money is ready. But is your hat genuine?"""
old-dschang,And he took the hat and examined it.
old-dschang,"A young girl came from an inner room and said: ""I wove the hat for Old Dschang myself. There must be a red thread in it."""
old-dschang,"And sure enough, there was."
old-dschang,"Then old Wang gave young We the ten million pieces of copper, and the latter now believed that Old Dschang was really a saint."
old-dschang,So he once more went over the hills to look for him.
old-dschang,"He asked the forest-keepers, but they could tell him naught."
old-dschang,"Sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old Wang, but he had also disappeared."
old-dschang,"When several years had passed he once more came to Yangdschou, and was walking in the meadow before the city gate."
old-dschang,There he met Old Dschang's plow-boy.
old-dschang,"The latter cried out: ""How are you? How are you?"" and drew out ten pounds of gold, which he gave to him, saying: ""My mistress told me to give you this. My master is this very moment drinking tea with old Wang in the inn."""
old-dschang,"Young We followed the plow-boy, intending to greet his brother-in-law."
old-dschang,But when he reached the inn there was no one in sight.
old-dschang,And when he turned around the plow-boy had disappeared as well.
old-dschang,And since that time no one ever heard from Old Dschang again.

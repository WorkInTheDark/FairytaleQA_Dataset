the-believing-husbands,Once upon a time there dwelt in the land of Erin a young man who was seeking a wife.
the-believing-husbands,Of all the maidens round about none pleased him as well as the only daughter of a farmer.
the-believing-husbands,The girl was willing and the father was willing.
the-believing-husbands,Very soon they were married and went to live at the farm.
the-believing-husbands,"By and bye the season came when they must cut the peats and pile them up to dry, so that they might have fires in the winter."
the-believing-husbands,"So on a fine day the girl and her husband, and the father and his wife all went out upon the moor."
the-believing-husbands,They worked hard for many hours.
the-believing-husbands,"At length grew hungry, so the young woman was sent home to bring them food, and also to give the horses their dinner."
the-believing-husbands,"When she went into the stables, she suddenly saw the heavy pack-saddle of the speckled mare just over her head."
the-believing-husbands,"She jumped and said to herself: 'Suppose that pack-saddle were to fall and kill me, how dreadful it would be!'"
the-believing-husbands,"and she sat down just under the pack-saddle she was so much afraid of, and began to cry."
the-believing-husbands,Now the others out on the moor grew hungrier and hungrier. ' What can have become of her?' asked they.
the-believing-husbands,"At length the mother declared that she would wait no longer, and must go and see what had happened."
the-believing-husbands,"As the bride was nowhere in the kitchen or the dairy, the old woman went into the stable."
the-believing-husbands,She found her daughter weeping bitterly.
the-believing-husbands,"'What is the matter, my dove?'"
the-believing-husbands,"and the girl answered, between her sobs: 'When I came in and saw the pack-saddle over my head, I thought how dreadful it would be if it fell and killed me.'"
the-believing-husbands,She cried louder than before.
the-believing-husbands,"The old woman struck her hands together: 'Ah, to think of it! if that were to be, what should I do?'"
the-believing-husbands,She sat down by her daughter.
the-believing-husbands,They both wrung their hands and let their tears flow.
the-believing-husbands,"'Something strange must have occurred,' exclaimed the old farmer on the moor, who by this time was not only hungry, but cross. ' I must go after them.'"
the-believing-husbands,And he went and found them in the stable.
the-believing-husbands,"'What is the matter?' asked he. ' Oh!' replied his wife, 'when our daughter came home, did she not see the pack-saddle over her head. She thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her.' ' Ah, to think of it!'"
the-believing-husbands,"exclaimed he, striking his hands together."
the-believing-husbands,He sat down beside them and wept too.
the-believing-husbands,As soon as night fell the young man returned full of hunger.
the-believing-husbands,"There they were, all crying together in the stable."
the-believing-husbands,'What is the matter?' asked he.
the-believing-husbands,"'When thy wife came home,' answered the farmer, 'she saw the pack-saddle over her head. She thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her.' ' Well, but it didn't fall,' replied the young man."
the-believing-husbands,"He went off to the kitchen to get some supper, leaving them to cry as long as they liked."
the-believing-husbands,"The next morning he got up with the sun, and said to the old man and to the old woman and to his wife: 'Farewell: my foot shall not return to the house till I have found other three people as silly as you.'"
the-believing-husbands,"He walked away till he came to the town, and seeing the door of a cottage standing open wide."
the-believing-husbands,He entered.
the-believing-husbands,"No man was present, but only some women spinning at their wheels."
the-believing-husbands,"'You do not belong to this town,' said he."
the-believing-husbands,"'You speak truth,' they answered, 'nor you either?'"
the-believing-husbands,"'I do not,' replied he, 'but is it a good place to live in?'"
the-believing-husbands,The women looked at each other.
the-believing-husbands,"' The men of the town are so silly that we can make them believe anything we please,' said they. ' Well, here is a gold ring,' replied he, 'and I will give it to the one amongst you who can make her husband believe the most impossible thing.'"
the-believing-husbands,He left them.
the-believing-husbands,"As soon as the first husband came home his wife said to him: 'Thou art sick!' 'Am I?' asked he. ' Yes, thou art,' she answered; 'take off thy clothes and lie down.'"
the-believing-husbands,So he did.
the-believing-husbands,When he was in his bed his wife went to him and said: 'Thou art dead.'
the-believing-husbands,"'Oh, am I?' asked he. ' Thou art,' said she; 'shut thine eyes and stir neither hand nor foot.'"
the-believing-husbands,And dead he felt sure he was.
the-believing-husbands,Soon the second man came home.
the-believing-husbands,His wife said to him: 'You are not my husband!'
the-believing-husbands,"'Oh, am I not?' asked he. ' No, it is not you,' answered she."
the-believing-husbands,He went away and slept in the wood.
the-believing-husbands,When the third man arrived his wife gave him his supper.
the-believing-husbands,"After that he went to bed, just as usual."
the-believing-husbands,"The next morning a boy knocked at the door, bidding him attend the burial of the man who was dead."
the-believing-husbands,He was just going to get up when his wife stopped him.
the-believing-husbands,"'Time enough,' said she."
the-believing-husbands,He lay still till he heard the funeral passing the window.
the-believing-husbands,"'Now rise, and be quick,' called the wife."
the-believing-husbands,"The man jumped out of bed in a great hurry, and began to look about him."
the-believing-husbands,"'Why, where are my clothes?' asked he."
the-believing-husbands,"'Silly that you are, they are on your back, of course,' answered the woman. ' Are they?' said he."
the-believing-husbands,"'They are,' said she, 'and make haste lest the burying be ended before you get there.'"
the-believing-husbands,"Then off he went, running hard."
the-believing-husbands,"When the mourners saw a man coming towards them with nothing on but his nightshirt, they forgot in their fright what they were there for, and fled to hide themselves."
the-believing-husbands,And the naked man stood alone at the head of the coffin.
the-believing-husbands,Very soon a man came out of the wood and spoke to him.
the-believing-husbands,"'Do you know me?' 'Not I,' answered the naked man."
the-believing-husbands,'I do not know you.'
the-believing-husbands,"'But why are you naked?' asked the first man. ' Am I naked? My wife told me that I had all my clothes on,' answered he. ' And my wife told me that I myself was dead,' said the man in the coffin."
the-believing-husbands,But at the sound of his voice the two men were so terrified that they ran straight home.
the-believing-husbands,The man in the coffin got up and followed them.
the-believing-husbands,"It was his wife that gained the gold ring, as he had been sillier than the other two."

skalunda-giant,"In the Skalunda mountain, near the church, there once lived a giant in the early days, who no longer felt comfortable after the church had been built there."
skalunda-giant,He decided that he could no longer stand the ringing of the church bells; so he emigrated and settled down on an island far out in the North Sea.
skalunda-giant,"Once upon a time a ship was wrecked on this island, and among those saved were several people from Skalunda."
skalunda-giant,"""From where do you hail?"""
skalunda-giant,"asked the giant, who by now had grown old and blind, and sat warming himself before a log fire."
skalunda-giant,"""We are from Skalunda,"" said one of the men saved."
skalunda-giant,"""Give me your hand, so that I may feel whether there is still warm blood to be found in the Swedish land,"" said the giant."
skalunda-giant,"The man, who feared to shake hands with the giant, drew a red-hot bar of iron from the fire and handed it to him."
skalunda-giant,"He seized it firmly, and pressed it so hard that the molten iron ran down between his fingers."
skalunda-giant,"""Yes, there is still warm blood to be found in Sweden,"" said he."
skalunda-giant,"""And tell me,"" he continued, ""is Skalunda mountain still standing?"""
skalunda-giant,"""No, the hens have scratched it away,"" the man answered."
skalunda-giant,"""How could it last?"" said the giant."
skalunda-giant,"""My wife and daughter piled it up in the course of a single Sunday morning. But surely the Hallenberg and the Hunneberg are still standing, for those I built myself."""
skalunda-giant,"When the man had confirmed this, the giant wanted to know whether Karin was still living in Stommen."
skalunda-giant,"And when they told him that she was, he gave them a girdle, and with it the message that Karin was to wear it in remembrance of him."
skalunda-giant,The men took the girdle and gave it to Karin upon their return home.
skalunda-giant,"But before Karin put it on, she clasped it around the oak-tree that grew in the court."
skalunda-giant,"No sooner had she done so than the oak tore itself out of the ground, and flew to the North, borne away by the storm-wind."
skalunda-giant,"In the place where it had stood was a deep pit, and the roots of the tree were so enormous that one of the best springs in Stommen flows from one of the root-holes to this very day."

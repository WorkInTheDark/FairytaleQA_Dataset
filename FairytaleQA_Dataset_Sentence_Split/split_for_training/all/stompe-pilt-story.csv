stompe-pilt,"Not far from Baalsberg, near Filkestad in the Willandsharad, there is a hill in which a giant named Stompe Pilt once used to live."
stompe-pilt,It happened one day that a goat-herd was driving his flock up the hill in which Stompe Pilt dwelt.
stompe-pilt,"""Who is there?"" cried the giant."
stompe-pilt,He rushed out of his hill with a hunk of flint-rock in his fist.
stompe-pilt,"""I am, if that's what you want to know!"" shouted the shepherd-lad and continued driving his goats up the hill."
stompe-pilt,"""If you come here, I will squash you as I squash this stone!"" cried the giant."
stompe-pilt,He crushed it into fine sand between his fingers.
stompe-pilt,"""And I will squash you till the water runs out, just as I squash this stone!"""
stompe-pilt,"answered the shepherd-lad, drawing a fresh cheese from his pocket, and pressing it hard, so that the water ran from his fingers."
stompe-pilt,"""Are you not frightened?"" asked the giant."
stompe-pilt,"""Of you? Certainly not!"" was the youth's reply."
stompe-pilt,"""Then we will fight with one another!"""
stompe-pilt,proposed the giant.
stompe-pilt,"""As you choose,"" replied the shepherd, ""but first we must abuse each other so that we can get into a proper rage. As we abuse each other we will grow angry, and when we are angry we will fight!"""
stompe-pilt,"""But I shall begin by abusing you,"" said the giant."
stompe-pilt,"""As you choose,"" said the youth, ""but then it will be my turn."""
stompe-pilt,"""May a troll with a crooked nose take you!"" yelled the giant."
stompe-pilt,"""May a flying devil carry you off!"""
stompe-pilt,answered the shepherd and he shot a sharp arrow against the giant's body with his bow.
stompe-pilt,"""What was that?"" asked the giant, and tried to pull the arrow out of his body."
stompe-pilt,"""That was a word of abuse,"" said the shepherd."
stompe-pilt,"""How does it come to have feathers?"" asked the giant."
stompe-pilt,"""The better to fly with,"" answered the shepherd."
stompe-pilt,"""Why does it stick so tight?"""
stompe-pilt,the giant continued.
stompe-pilt,"""Because it has taken root in your body,"" was the shepherd's answer."
stompe-pilt,"""Have you any other abusive words of the same sort?"" asked the giant."
stompe-pilt,"""Here is another one,"" replied the youth."
stompe-pilt,He shot another arrow into the giant.
stompe-pilt,"""Ouch, ouch!"" cried Stompe Pilt, ""are you still not angry enough for us to come to blows?"""
stompe-pilt,"""No, I have not abused you enough as yet,"" said the shepherd and aimed another arrow."
stompe-pilt,"""Lead your goats wherever you choose! If I cannot stand your abusive words, I surely will not be able to bear up against your blows,"" cried Stompe Pilt."
stompe-pilt,He jumped back into his hill.
stompe-pilt,And that is how the shepherd gained the victory.
stompe-pilt,He was brave and did not let the stupid giant frighten him.

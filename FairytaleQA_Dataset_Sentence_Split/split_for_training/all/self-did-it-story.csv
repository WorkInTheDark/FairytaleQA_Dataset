self-did-it,"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind flour, because such strange things kept happening there."
self-did-it,"But there was a poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during the night."
self-did-it,"""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."""
self-did-it,"But the woman said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her children to eat."
self-did-it,So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night and grind some flour.
self-did-it,"When she came, she lit a fire under a big tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the fire, and began to knit."
self-did-it,After a time a girl came in and nodded to her.
self-did-it,"""Good evening!"""
self-did-it,said she to the woman.
self-did-it,"""Good evening!"" said the woman; kept her seat, and went on knitting."
self-did-it,But then the girl who had come in began to pull apart the fire on the hearth.
self-did-it,The woman built it up again.
self-did-it,"""What is your name?"" asked the girl from underground."
self-did-it,"""Self is my name,"" said the woman."
self-did-it,"That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull the fire apart."
self-did-it,"Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built it all up again."
self-did-it,"Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground."
self-did-it,"Then the latter screamed and ran away, crying: ""Father, father! Self burned me!"""
self-did-it,"""Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer for it!"""
self-did-it,came the answer from below the hill.

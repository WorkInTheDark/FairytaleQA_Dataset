evil-one-kitta-grau,"One day the devil met Kitta Grau: ""Where have you been, old man?"""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"asked Kitta Grau, for she recognized him."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""Well,"" said the evil one, ""I have been out on the farm where the newly wedded couple live. This is the third time I have tried to sow dissension between them. But they think so much of each other that it is a sheer impossibility."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""You talk like a real stupid. That is something I could bring about the very first time I went there,"" said Kitta Grau."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""If you can do that, you shall have a splendid pair of shoes,"" was the evil one's reply."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""Mind you keep your word!"" said Kitta, and turned toward the farm."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"There the woman was home alone, for her husband had gone to the forest."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Kitta said to the young wife: ""You really have a splendid husband."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""And that is the truth,"" the woman replied, ""for he grants my every wish before it is spoken."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""But take my word for it,"" said Kitta, ""there is still a bit of deceit in him. He has a pair of long hairs under his chin. If you could get at them with a razor, and cut them off while he is asleep, then he would be altogether without malice."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""Well,"" said the woman, ""if that will help, I will be sure to keep an eye open after dinner and attend to it, for then he always takes a little noon-day nap."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,Then Kitta Grau went out into the forest to the husband and bade him good-day.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""You really have a very good wife,"" said Kitta."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""She could not be better,"" replied the husband."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""Well you might be mistaken for all that,"" said Kitta."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""When you come home, be on your guard. When you go to take your noon-day nap, she has in mind to cut your throat. So be sure not to go to sleep."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,The husband did not think much of the matter.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Still, he thanked Kitta Grau for her trouble."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Then he went home and ate his dinner, laid down and pretended to fall asleep at once."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Then his wife went to his shaving-kit, took out his razor, went softly up to him and took hold of his chin with her hand."
evil-one-kitta-grau,Up flew the man.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""Do you want to murder me?"" he cried, and gave his wife such a thump that she measured her full length on the floor."
evil-one-kitta-grau,And from that day forward there was no peace in the house.
evil-one-kitta-grau,Now Kitta Grau was to receive her reward from the evil one.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"But he was so afraid of her that he did not venture to give her the shoes until he stood on one side of a stream, while she stood on the other, and then he passed them over to her on a long pole."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""You are ever so much worse than I am,"" he told Kitta Grau."
evil-one-kitta-grau,The black man had made a bargain with a merchant.
evil-one-kitta-grau,He had promised him that all goods which he might buy he should sell again within three weeks' time at a handsome profit.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"But, if he had prospered, after seven years had passed he was to be the devil's own."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"And he did prosper, for no matter what manner of old trash the merchant bought, and if it were no more than an old worn-out fur coat, he was always able to sell it again, and always at a profit."
evil-one-kitta-grau,Kitta Grau came into his shop and showed him the handsome shoes the evil one had given her.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"So the merchant said: ""May heaven keep me from him! He will surely fetch me when the time comes. I have made a pact with him and I have been unable to buy anything without selling it again in three weeks' time."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Then Kitta Grau said: ""Buy me, for I am sure no one will buy me from you!"""
evil-one-kitta-grau,And that is what the merchant did.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"He bought Kitta, had her disrobe and cover herself with tar, and roll in a pile of feathers."
evil-one-kitta-grau,Then he put her in a glass cage as though she were a bird.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Now the first week went by, and the second week went by, and the third week went by, and no one appeared who wanted to buy the curious bird."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"And then, in due time, came the evil one, and wanted to fetch his merchant."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""Have patience,"" said the merchant, ""I still have something I have bought, but have not been able to sell again in three weeks' time."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,"""That is something I'd like to see,"" said the black man."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Then the merchant showed him Kitta Grau, sitting in her glass cage."
evil-one-kitta-grau,"But no sooner had the evil one seen the handsome bird than he cried: ""Oh, I see! It is you Kitta Grau! No one who knows you would buy you!"""
evil-one-kitta-grau,And with that he hurried on his way.
evil-one-kitta-grau,"Thus Kitta Grau could help do evil, and help do good."

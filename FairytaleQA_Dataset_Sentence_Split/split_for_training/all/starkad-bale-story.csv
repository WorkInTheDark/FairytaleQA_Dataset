starkad-bale,"Starkad, the hero of the legends, the bravest warrior in the army of the North, had fallen into disgrace with the king because of a certain princess, so he wandered up into Norland, and settled down at Rude in Tuna, where he was known as the Thrall of the Alders or the Red Fellow."
starkad-bale,"In Balbo, nine miles from Rude, dwelt another hero, Bale, a good friend and companion-at-arms of Starkad."
starkad-bale,"One morning Starkad climbed the Klefberg in Tuna, and called over to Bale: ""Bale in Balbo, are you awake?"""
starkad-bale,"""Red Fellow!"" answered Bale, nine miles away, ""the sun and I wake together! But how goes it with you?"""
starkad-bale,"""None too well. I eat salmon morning, noon and night. Come over with a bit of meat!"""
starkad-bale,"""I'll come!"""
starkad-bale,"Bale called back, and in a few hours time he was down in Tuna with an elk under each arm."
starkad-bale,"The following morning Bale in Balbo stood on a hill in Borgsjo and called: ""Red Fellow! Are you awake?"""
starkad-bale,"""The sun and I wake together!"" answered Starkad."
starkad-bale,"""And how goes it with you?"""
starkad-bale,"""Alas, I have nothing to eat but meat! Elk in the morning, elk at noon and elk at night. Come over and bring a fish-tail along with you!"""
starkad-bale,"""I'm coming!"""
starkad-bale,"called out Starkad, and in a short time he had joined his friend with a barrel of salmon under each arm."
starkad-bale,"In this fashion the two friends provided themselves with all the game to be found in the woods and in the water, and spread terror and destruction throughout the countryside."
starkad-bale,"But one evening, when they were just returning to the sea from an excursion, a black cloud came up, and a tempest broke."
starkad-bale,"They hurried along as fast as they could; but got no further than Vattjom, where a flash of lightning struck Starkad and flung him to the ground."
starkad-bale,"His friend and companion-at-arms buried him beneath a stone cairn, about which he set five rocks: two at his feet, two at his shoulders, and one at his head; and that grave, measuring twenty ells in length, may still be seen near the river."
